I've had this site since 2019 and have been blogging since around mid-2022. 
* I want for it to capture the kind of person that I am/was. 
* I use it to store the things that I think about and make, as well as owning/storing my own data.

This site is hosted (for free) on GitHub Pages. 
* This site's code is available [here](https://github.com/reeshuffled/reeshuffled.github.io).
* My domain was bought from [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).

I owe much if not all of my website to free and open source software.
* I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation.
* I use [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my CSS framework. 
* I use [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) for the cascading grid layouts on my [Digital Garden](/garden) and Personal Data pages.
