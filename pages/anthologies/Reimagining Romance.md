All links in this anthology are to things that I have written on my site. In this anthology I am attempting to "glue" my various thoughts on romance together in a more singular, cohesive piece.

## Part I: Problems With Romance

I do not think that romance/romantic relationships should be a primary life goal. 
* This is sometimes referred to as "de-centering romance".
* I have no problem with romance _per se_, but I think that the channeling/implementation of romance into romantic relationships should be only a portion of your total relationships/energy/time. 

For one, romantic desire is fickle and sometimes hard to cultivate and keep alive, all of which makes me believe it to be a dubious foundation for a long-term relationship.

I think that the social organization and social messaging around romance and marriage makes us expect too much out of these relationships.

The problem with romance is that it has a lot of conceptual baggage, like societal norms, many of which are outdated and don't serve people as well as they used to, if they ever did at all.

## Part II: Reimagining Romance

I don't think of romance as a mind-independent category. Not only is it socially influenced, it is personally constructed (unique to each person) and necessarily exclusive (can only be applied to a limited number people in your life).
* [Romance Is Personally Constructed and Necessarily Exclusive]({% post_url 2024-12-11-Romance-Is-Personally-Constructed %})

There are a number of different positions that you can hold in regards to romance.
* Romantic Apologist: Someone who thinks that romance is the right way to organize society and that romantic love is the highest form of love. 
* Romantic Reformer: Romance has its place, but romance itself or values surrounding it have to be changed. 
* [Romantic Abolitionist]({% post_url 2024-02-22-Romantic-abolitionism %}): Romance has no place in society and should be abandoned altogether and instead embracing love in general. 

While I think it is an interesting intellectual exercise to [imagine a post-romantic world]({% post_url 2024-04-02-Imagining-a-post-romantic-world %}), I fall somewhere between the Reformer and Abolitionist position. I recognize the appeal of romance and letting people construct it for themselves while de-centering it, but I choose not to identify with it.
* [Non-Romantic Partnerships]({% post_url 2024-07-05-Non-Romantic-Partnership %})

I think that non-monogamous romance that doesn't necessarily lead to partnership would be the ideal state of romance in society.
* Romance should be light & fun, it can lead to something, but no worries if not.
* I feel that a lot of people choose not to pursue things because they are scared about the long-term, but also that a lot of people stay in the long-term when they really shouldn't.
