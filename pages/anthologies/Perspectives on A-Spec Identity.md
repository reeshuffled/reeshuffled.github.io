> These are articles that I have written from my perspective of identifying as A-Spec and exploring it through theoretical or practical lenses. I don't ever want to speak for someone else or erase their own perspective, I just want to offer new/different ways of understanding sexuality and identity.

## What is A-Spec?

A-Spec is a term for being on the Asexual (ace-spec) and/or Aromantic (aro-spec) Spectrums. You can identify as A-Spec as an umbrella term, or as someone who identifies themselves as some other identity within the Ace-Spec (e.g. graysexual) or Aro-Spec (e.g. demiromantic).

> I think that a lot about A-Spec identity puts us at odds with current social understanding and organization of relationships. While I think that it is certainly possible for us to integrate into existing systems, I also wanted to explore possibilities beyond.
