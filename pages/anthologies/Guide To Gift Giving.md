## Why give gifts?

[Not everyone wants or needs things]({% post_url 2024-12-02-Not-Everyone-Wants-Or-Needs-Things %}), however this doesnâ€™t really help us out of our most basic conundrum: that we want to get someone a gift either out of social obligation, or because we want to show the other person that we care.

You can use gifts as a signal of care or a signifier of how well you know them/listen to them. Giving a gift can mark/create the occasion, elevating it into a higher place in memory.

## General Tips

* Always give a card if you can
    * Use it to explain your thought process as a way of gifting the thought too
* Keep a Pinterest board/section per person
    * You essentially are creating a mood board per person which can allow you to fill in gaps with suggestions from Pinterest, or just by you looking at the visualization
* Making something yourself is a great way to lower the expectations of quality of the gift while increasing the sentimental value of the gift
* Keep a list/spreadsheet to remember who you want or need to buy birthday, Christmas, etc. gifts for
* Buy things for people when you see them and keep them in a box to pull from when the time comes
* If you don't have a big gift to give someone, get them a few smaller ones together to bundle them
    * You could make a themed basket
        * Favorite Things
        * Specific occasions (Moving, sickness, etc.)
* [Regifting is completely acceptable]({% post_url 2023-10-11-On-Regifting %})!

## When should I give gifts?

Being intentional about gift giving means expanding beyond the basic occasions of gift giving.

* When meeting someone for the first time
* When going to someone's house when they are hosting
* Birthday
* Anniversary
    * Friendaverseries absolutely count!
* Holidays

## What can I give?

Although I did say earlier that not everyone wants or needs things, there are still ways to give things to people like that. However, you also have the option to give non-things to them as well, which will usually work better if you know them well enough.

[You can give things or non-things]({% post_url 2024-12-02-Gifting-Things-Vs-Non-Things %}).
* Things (Consumables, Elevated Essentials, Hobby Items, etc.)
* Non-Things (Experiences, Charitable Donation, Cash, No Gift, etc.)
