I do not think that romance/romantic relationships should be a primary life goal. 
* This is sometimes referred to as "de-centering romance".
* I have no problem with romance _per se_, but I think that the channeling/implementation of romance into romantic relationships should be only a portion of your total relationships/energy/time. 

[Abolishing Romance](/anthologies/abolishing-romance)

I don't care if you have a partnership, but just don't call it romantic! Most people say that a good relationship starts with friendship which seems like the real base and that romance is just a veneer on top of it, so we don't even need romance fr

I think that non-monogamous romance that doesn't necessarily lead to partnership would be the ideal state of romance in society.
* Romance should be light & fun, it can lead to something, but no worries if not.
* I feel that a lot of people choose not to pursue things because they are scared about the long-term, but also that a lot of people stay in the long-term when they really shouldn't.

I think that for child-rearing or other domestic tasks, that [Non-Romantic Partnerships]({% post_url 2024-07-05-Non-Romantic-Partnership %}) could fulfill the role that romantic relationships currently play in that regard, perhaps even better than romantic relationships.
* It takes a village after all!
* Maybe this leads to more people living in a commune with their partners, friends, and/or family.

All in all, I want to see a world with love at the center of all relationships and relationships at the center of life.
* My vision for romance is just my own vision, but there are steps that can be taken by individuals now in order to bring about a life with love at the center.

* This is not without precedent, in the book [The Other Significant Others]({% post_url 2024-03-25-The-Other-Significant-Others-by-Rhaina-Cohen %}), the author imagines "life with friendship at the center". In my mind, I am just expanding this idea of friendship into love at the center.
    * Love of family, friends, partners, etc.
