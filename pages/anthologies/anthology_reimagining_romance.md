Romance is not bad _per se_, but I think that centering it in your personal life and in society leads to a myriad of problems. All links in this anthology are to things that I have written on my site. In this anthology I am attempting to "glue" my various thoughts on romance together in a more singular, cohesive piece.

## Part I: Problems With Romance

I do not think that romance/romantic relationships should be a primary life goal. I have no problem with romantic relationships _per se_, but I think that they should be only a portion of your total relationships/energy/time.

Romantic desire is fickle and sometimes hard to cultivate and keep alive, all of which makes me believe it to be a dubious foundation for a long-term relationship.

There is no one way to cultivate a long-term partnership and I  think that the social messaging around romance and marriage makes us complacent in giving our all in those relationships, which makes us expect too much in return.

The problem with romance is that it has a lot of conceptual baggage, like societal norms, many of which are outdated and don't serve people as well as they used to, if they ever did at all.

## Part II: Reimagining Romance

There are a number of different positions that you can hold in regards to romance.
* Romantic Apologist: Someone who thinks that romance is the right way to organize society and that romantic love is the highest form of love. 
* Romantic Reformer: Romance has its place but romance itself or values surrounding it have to be changed. 
* [Romantic Abolitionist]({% post_url 2024-02-22-Romantic-abolitionism %}): Romance has no place in society and should be abandoned altogether and instead embracing love in general. 

While I think it is an interesting intellectual exercise to [imagine a post-romantic world]({% post_url 2024-04-02-Imagining-a-post-romantic-world %}), I fall somewhere in the Reformer position.

I think that non-monogamous romance that doesn't necessarily lead to partnership would be the ideal state of romance in society.
* Romance should be light & fun, it can lead to something, but no worries if not
* I feel that a a lot of people choose not to pursue things because they are scared about the long-term, but also that a lot of people stay in the long-term when they really should't.
