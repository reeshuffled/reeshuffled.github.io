This anthology is a mixture of articles that I am the most proud of and/or that were the most fun to write. A lot of times those two things are related, but not always!

I tried grouping these articles mostly for myself to understand what kind of things I like to write and why. Some articles fit into multiple categories and some resisted categorization, but I tried my best to be as accurate as possible for my own sake.

I'm sure that there are other reasons and articles that I have somehow missed, but I will continue to update this page as I write more.

I love writing retrospectives.
