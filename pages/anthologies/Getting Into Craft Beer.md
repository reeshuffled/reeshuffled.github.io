I love craft beer as you might have guessed from [my beer ratings page](/data/beer) or the [abundance of articles I've written about beer](/posts/all/#Beer). I also happen to think that everyone can learn to like beer. Obviously not everyone cares enough to learn to like beer, but I think that everyone has it in them to find a beer that they enjoy.

## Why get into craft beer?

From my article [Why Get Into Beer?]({% post_url 2023-10-24-Why-Get-Into-Beer? %}):
1. [There are kinds of flavors that are only really in beer]({% post_url 2023-10-24-Why-Get-Into-Beer? %}#new-gustatory-experiences)
2. [There are more places that you can go to when you are into beer]({% post_url 2023-10-24-Why-Get-Into-Beer? %}#travel-destinations--community-spaces)
3. [You can even have beer as a hobby and get back as much as you want to put in]({% post_url 2023-10-24-Why-Get-Into-Beer? %}#beer-as-an-interesthobby)

## How should I go about getting into craft beer?

Along your journey I would recommend that you download the app Untappd, which is pretty much *the* craft beer app. I use it religiously ([Why I rate every beer that I drink]({% post_url 2023-05-10-Why-I-Rate-Every-Beer-That-I-Drink %})), but I think that it is great for beer newcomers because it has so much information to help you find beers and also remember which beers you liked and didn't like.

I don't think that getting into craft beer is that hard. Tapping in is easy, but finding a beer/style you like can be harder. It will definitely take time, but that's okay if you just let yourself enjoy the journey.

2. [Develop your beer taste buds](https://homebrewacademy.com/how-to-like-beer/)
3. Try a lot of beer and slowly hone your idea of what you like and don't like (this doesn't have to be that expensive either!)
