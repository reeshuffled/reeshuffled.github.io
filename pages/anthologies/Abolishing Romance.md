## Part I: Problems With Romance

For one, romantic desire is fickle and sometimes hard to cultivate and keep alive, all of which makes me believe it to be a dubious foundation for a long-term relationship.

I think that the social organization and social messaging around romance and marriage makes us expect too much out of these relationships.

The problem with romance is that it has a lot of conceptual baggage, like societal norms, many of which are outdated and don't serve people as well as they used to, if they ever did at all.

## Part II: Can we reimagine romance?

In my article *[Can we reimagine romance?]({% post_url 2025-03-22-Can-we-reimagine-romance? %})*, I argue that while we could try to reimagine romance, that we might be better off just abandoning the concept entirely.

This is where [Romantic Abolitionism]({% post_url 2024-02-22-Romantic-abolitionism %}) comes in. This is a perfectly tenable philosophical standpoint in my opinion that holds that we need to stop using the concept of romance when it comes to relationships.
* I'm not saying to get rid of candlelit dinners with your sweetie or to eliminate the fun honeymoon phase with someone new, just that we can stop limiting love by categorizing it as romantic or not.

## Part III: What will it take to abolish romance?

The main task at hand is [Reimagining Relationships](/anthologies/reimagining-relationships), which is not easy and will likely look different for each person.

One small step I believe we can start is by distancing ourselves from invoking the concept of romance in our daily lives.
* In *[Everything is not romantic]({% post_url 2025-03-22-Everything-is-not-romantic %})*, I argue that we should probably start by not using the word romantic to describe the more grandiose concepts ("This place is so romantic" or "I need to romanticize my life more"). 
    * While I don't like being prescriptive about language and romanticize is technically a bit different than our contemporary concept of romance, I think we are better off trying to be more linguistically creative.

## Part IV: How does this help us?

In *[Imagining a post-romantic world]({% post_url 2024-04-02-Imagining-a-post-romantic-world %})*, I ask the question of "What do society and relationships look like if romance is abolished?"

As I talk about in Part I with the problems of romance, in not being under that paradigm we have absolute freedom in our relationships. I think that this can be us Kierkegaardian anxiety of "anxiety as the dizziness of freedom" and can feel overwhelming.
