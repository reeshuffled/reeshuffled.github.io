> Keep in mind that this is still a Work in Progress.

A lot of universities and Philosophy Departments teach Critical Thinking or aim to teach analytical thinking. While I think that these kind of thinking skills are important, I think that they are more indirect byproducts of being taught to think like a Philosopher. What is it to think like a Philosopher? I call it Philosophical Thinking, as a riff on Computational Thinking.

Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that involves various techniques and thought processes borrowed from computer science. This includes skills like:
* Decomposition: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts
* Pattern Recognition: Identifying patterns and relationships within data or problems
* Abstraction: Focusing on essential features and ignoring irrelevant details
* Algorithmic Thinking: Developing step-by-step solutions to problems

I want to see philosophical thinking be taught like computational thinking.

## What are the skills of Philosophical Thinking?

* Distinction Drawing
    * Fact and Opinion 
    * Rational, Irrational, Arational
* Concepts
    * Conceptual Engineering
    * Cluster Concepts
    * Conceptual Schema
    * How real are conceptual boundaries?
    * Piles, Holes, Surfaces
* Creating Value Systems
    * Evaluating Based on Values
    * Utilitarianism
    * Evaluating Scientific Theories on Theoretical Virtues
* Rhetorical Fallacies
    * https://thethinkingshop.org/products/critical-thinking-cards-deck 
* The Nature of a Question
    * what is the question really asking about
    * what unstated assumptions are there in the question
    * what utility is in the question’s answer

Writing is different than philosophical thinking, it is philosophical communication. The skill set is completely, but different and instructional focus is to be differentiated. 

I don’t think that symbolic logic is that useful. Some critical thinking about argumentation can help

## How is this different from critical or analytical thinking skills?

There is certainly overlap between the skill sets and concepts, but they are importantly different.

Critical thinking is the ability to objectively analyze information, evaluate evidence, and form a well-supported judgment or decision.

Critical Thinking Skills:
* Analysis: Breaking down complex information into component parts, identifying patterns, and examining relationships between them.
* Communication: Effectively conveying thoughts and ideas through verbal and written means, using clear and concise language.
* Inference: Drawing logical conclusions based on evidence and data, avoiding assumptions and leaps of faith.
* Evaluation: Assessing the credibility and reliability of sources, identifying biases and flaws in arguments, and weighing evidence.
* Independence: Thinking autonomously, resisting groupthink, and avoiding conformity to prevailing opinions.
* Objectivity: Maintaining a neutral and unbiased perspective, avoiding emotional manipulation, and considering multiple viewpoints.

Analytical thinking skills are about analyzing (examining methodically by separating into parts and studying their interrelations). These skills help individuals think critically about an issue, make decisions, and solve problems in any context.

Analytical Thinking Skills:
* Critical Thinking: The ability to question preconceived notions, identify issues or areas for improvement, and challenge assumptions.
* Data and Information Analysis: The ability to examine data and information, identify patterns, trends, and outliers, and draw meaningful conclusions.
* Problem-Solving: The ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts, identify causes and effects, and develop logical solutions.
* Communication: The ability to effectively present findings and solutions through oral or written presentations.
* Creativity: The ability to think outside the box and generate innovative ideas.
