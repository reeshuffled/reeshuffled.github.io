A lot of my previous work has been in making STEM education, Computer Science Education in particular, more fun and engaging.

## Gamification

* https://github.com/reeshuffled/syntax-tutor
* Change Maker
* Graph Guesser
* Speedy Math/Math Slayer
* Math Matrix
* Type Shooter/Type Racer

## Visualization + Interactivity

* Binary Explorer
* https://github.com/reeshuffled/mosaic
    * Code can be hard to visualize. Print statements is a kind of visualization because otherwise you can have no insight into the execution of your program.

## Synthesis

* https://github.com/tecanal/ar-turtle
    * Turtle has been around since Logo, Jeroo is just an iteration of it
* https://github.com/reeshuffled/parsons2play
    * Building on the idea of play is video games and trying to hijack student motivation/interest

## 1. Meme Maker 
- The student uses HTML and CSS to modify the image source and top and bottom caption texts of a meme.
- **Student Actions:**
    - Modify the text content of existing tags. (i.e. changing the text of the meme)
    - Modify the attributes of existing tags. (i.e. changing the <img> src to another image)
    - Modify the existing tags to transform them to different tags. (i.e. changing &lt;h1> to &lt;h3>)

## 2. Comic Creator
- The student uses HTML and CSS to create a multi-paneled webcomic with images and differently styled caption boxes.
- **Student Actions:**
    - Use &lt;div>, &lt;p>, &lt;u>, &lt;i>, &lt;b> tags. (i.e. making a comic panel with a rich text caption)
    - Use inline CSS styling. (i.e. changing the color of a caption)

## 3. Blog Publisher
- The student uses HTML and CSS to create a mock blog about one of their interests.
- **Student Actions:**
    - Use &lt;div>, &lt;table>, &lt;ul>, &lt;ol>, &lt;p>, &lt;h?>, and other ways of organizing information. (i.e. making a chart)
