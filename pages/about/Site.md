I sometimes refer to this site as a "web collage" because I am trying to pulling together a lot of data and thoughts from all kinds of different places and put them together in new and interesting ways.

I've had this site since 2019 and have been blogging since around mid-2022. 
* I want for it to capture the kind of person that I am/was. 
* I use it to store the things that I think about and make, as well as owning/storing my own data.
* The Software Project pages are among the oldest on my site because I initially started a personal website as something more of a portfolio.

This site is hosted (for free) on GitHub Pages. 
* This site's code is available [here](https://github.com/reeshuffled/reeshuffled.github.io).
* My domain was bought from [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/).

I owe much if not all of my website to free and open source software.
* I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation.
* I use [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my CSS framework. 
* I use [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) for the cascading grid layouts on my [Digital Garden](/posts/all) and Personal Data pages.
