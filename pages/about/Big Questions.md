Inspired by [Tracy Durnell's page](https://tracydurnell.com/questions/) of the same name.

A lot of my writing is an effort to understand the world around me. These questions are not always at the forefront of my mind while writing, but I think they do help trace an undercurrent to a lot of my work on this site.

I have the more central questions bolded, with the various articles that I have written and deemed to fall under that question. I also identified a sub-question that I think was at the center of each post.

**How can we connect to people (at scale)?**
* [Building Yourself in Public]({% post_url 2024-01-26-Building-Yourself-In-Public %}): What if we used social media to share parts of our lives to show ourselves "building in public"?
* [Hosting for Emerging Adults](/anthologies/hosting-for-emerging-adults): How can young people host gatherings to foster connection between friends/peers?
* [Personal Community Building](/anthologies/personal-community-building): How can someone find, make, and keep friends while centering friendship in their life?

**What are the possibilities of non-monogamy in transforming the way that we connect and relate to others?**
* [Reimagining Romance](/anthologies/reimagining-romance): What are the current problems with our social concept of romance and how could it be different?

**How can we get more people to eat plant-based?**
* [Lazy Vegan Meals]({% post_url 2024-07-31-Lazy-Vegan-Meals %}): How can we make eating plant-based easier/less effort?
* [Reducetarian Splits]({% post_url 2025-01-03-The-Effects-of-Different-Reducetarian-Splits %}): How can we categorize/organize diets that aim to reduce meat consumption in different ways?
* [Vegan at Home]({% post_url 2024-08-01-Vegan-at-Home %}): Can we create a Reducetarian split that maximizes flexibility and control?

**How can we teach children ethical principles in order to accelerate their own moral development and/or help them be the best members of a polite society?**
* [Teaching Children Ethics]({% post_url 2025-02-23-Teaching-Children-Ethics %}): How can we teach children ethics in developmentally appropriate milestones?
