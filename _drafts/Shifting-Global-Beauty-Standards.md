Is the American beauty standard becoming more Asian? Is a global beauty standard forming?

Anecdotally I've seen much more WMAF (White Male Asian Female) couples and more desire for Asian women online and in person. Is this racial preference? Is this fetish? In this essay I will argue that it is instead best understood as Asian women's intersection with the American beauty standards.

"With images of ideal beauty bombarding us daily, it is easy to forget that standards of beauty are arbitrary and they vary greatly both from one culture to another and over time." ([Bradley University](https://www.bradley.edu/sites/bodyproject/standards/)). This is true, but I believe that we are starting to see a homogenized global beauty standard be formed. Industrialization and globalization driven by capitalism have created a speed of cultural exchange mediated via the internet. The internet has drastically changed how cultural exchange happens, which means that media is now one of the largest cultural exports that a country can have.

I think that beauty standards in a capitalist society is all about control and perfection over everything. Perfect teeth, hair, skin, and figure are just a few among the various bodily parameters. I believe that Asian women now exemplify the beauty standard better than other women because of racial/social standards both for Asians and Asian-Americans. The beauty standards that Asian and Asian-American women are under are different, but they have some overlap and interaction.

Hallyu has had an effect on beauty standards, like an increase in plastic surgery rates ([Eun, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3835495/)) and a potential growing homogenization of beauty in Asia ([Seoul Beats](https://seoulbeats.com/2015/04/hallyus-homogenisation-beauty-asia/)).

Young Asian women are the main consumers of Hallyu ([The Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/02/398_303238.html)). This data doesn't mention Asian-American women, but I have to imagine that they are among the main consumers in the U.S. because Asian-American representation in media is not the best ([Dear Asian Youth](https://www.dearasianyouth.org/article/evolution-of-asian-representation-in-western-media)). With a lack of good options, it would make sense to turn to media produced by Asian countries to see people who look like you ([Ju & Lee, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273104808_The_Korean_Wave_and_Asian_Americans_The_ethnic_meanings_of_transnational_Korean_pop_culture_in_the_USA)).

For example, Asian-American women have drove much growth in the U.S. skincare industry ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/how-asian-american-women-are-driving-growth-skincare-industry-n866671)). There are cultural forces in South Korea 

Beauty standards require enforcement and in a more individualistic society people are less likely to infringe on someone else's appearance. Asian women are genetically predisposed to being shorter than other races ([MedicineNet](https://www.medicinenet.com/height_women/article.htm)), but that doesn't have anything to do with weight. Studies show that the longer that Asian immigrant families stay longer in the U.S. BMI tends to increase ([Wang et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21153765/), [Lauderdale and Rathouz](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11033989/), [Goel et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598917/)). There are a lot of societal factors of East Asian countries in particular that heavily punish people that stray from the beauty standard.
