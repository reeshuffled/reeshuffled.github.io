A committed long-term relationship (i.e. romantic partnership or close friendship) is about sharing life.
* This isn't a new idea by any means, but I think that it has been one of the more powerful lenses I've used to think through whether I want a relationship or not.
* This is a separate, but related concept to love.
    * Sharing is caring and love is care, but you can have love without a long-term relationship and a long-term relationship without love.
    * romance has nothing to do with this but rather is about if you want partnership or not
        * for others they just only understand life in terms of romance and sharing and are never able to unlearn or challenge the assumption that life is automatically better in a partnership 

## What kind of sharing?

Sharing life means sharing:
* Burdens
* Joys
* Presence & Experience
* Intimacy

I didn't mention sharing interests because I don't think that is integral to any relationship *per se*, rather it just allows you to have more to talk about or do together. At the very least you should be able to appreciate and talk about it with your partner if you think it would make them happy to share that with you sometimes it is just a personal thing.

### Sharing Joy

* For some people, a life with joys unshared means they enjoy it less or are enjoying it less than could be as multiplied through sharing and talking about it
* It’s also nice to have double the amount of joys and sometimes it’s easier to be happy for someone else instead of yourself so it makes sense why someone would want to have another person whose joy they would be invested in 
* I believe that some people feel less joy than others (in that the threshold to feel joy is higher or less things bring them joy) but being able to live vicariously through someone might help

### Sharing Burdens

* for some people the burden of life is too hard or they have strengths and weaknesses / interests and desires that makes it in their best interest to partner with someone who is either similar or very different to them
* it was more about child rearing then but now it is more expensive to live even without children
* some people don't like being seen as weak and/or a burden so don't ever want to share burdens with others but might make them more likely to seek someone out who does

### Sharing Presence & Experience

* this is doing things together, but this includes parallel play
* presence is the most neutral of the three no positive or negative entirely but rather some people who prefer spending parallel play casual intimacy type stuff
* some people just can’t be alone or don’t like to

### Sharing Intimacy

* this can mean a lot of things to different people
* sexual intimacy but also sensual intimacy (cuddling, massage, kissing)
* intimacy of shared knowledge/understanding of the other person (being known)
    * inside jokes
* some people just want to have their partner be their best friend which is probably a max out on this category
    * “partner in crime”

## Nature vs nurture?

at the risk of sounding too much like love languages it makes sense to align with people or who are open to it

it genuinely is a preferences thing 

## Sharing comes more easily to some than others

* Sharing things also means compromise which is the part that I'm not yet ready for because i am selfish and independent and don’t like to lose out on something or make myself uncomfortable 
* some people are just fine on their own or can choose to share things more selectively with certain people around them
* “this world that i have built for myself, i don’t want to share it with anyone”
    * all aspects of personality for myself
