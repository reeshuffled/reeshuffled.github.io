## My Personal Fitness Background

I grew up swimming and playing other team sports but I never had to do any kind of individual training outside of practice. As a result, when I stopped swimming and started college, I didn't really have any good personal fitness habits or knowledge.

When I was in high school a friend of mine was into lifting because of what he did for football so he had a bench in his basement and I would go workout with him from time to time. It was pretty simple and fun with slight focus on form but mostly just as a way to hang out and talk to each other because I didn't really have any particular strength or aesthetic goals.

## Starting Lifting

It wasn't until April 2023 when I really started to want to lift weights and I bought [NordicTrack iSelect Dumbbells](https://www.theverge.com/23022416/nordictrack-iselect-adjustable-dumbbells-review-amazon-alexa).

I found a beginner workout routine Push-Pull-Legs split online on Reddit and followed it pretty faithfully only because I had no idea what I was doing. The post spoke with enough clarity and confidence that I just blindly accepted the point of view. However I don't fault myself for doing this and in fact I would probably recommend this approach to other beginners. There is so much conflicting information out there on exercise science that can easily be confusing without the proper context of your personal goals as well as the background knowledge to be able to separate pseudoscience from actual science.

I didn't do the Legs portion of the split because I also had a Schwinn Upright Exercise Bike that I was using for cardio and I didn't want my legs to be sore after a workout to prevent me from biking. While I don't bike as much anymore, partially because that bike stopped working, I still don't work legs because I prefer to walk/run on the treadmill now.

I wasn’t very consistent and didn’t know exactly how hard to be working which was a bit of a self-reinforcing loop because the lack of consistency called lack of results which made me be less consistent.

It wasn't until July of 2024 where I started to take it more seriously. I started again with the routine that I found on Reddit, but also talk more to my brother who knew more about lifting than me. I also found science based lifting creators in August which exposed me to a lot more concepts and terminology which help give me the tools to think critically about my own workout program.

## Now and Beyond

I want to get stronger/bigger and have been starting to notice some gains, but more than that I have just felt that I’ve had a more energy and far better mental health.

its a part of my routine now, one that i plan my days and weeks around especially when im travelling bc i wanna be consfitsnf  

i don’t do legs because i run and bike for cardio in the gym so i don’t want to not be able to do that and i think they are my best natural muscles but i may eventually start doing it for body balance if i notice a big difference 

i just do a general push pull rest split
