## On Progress and Motivation

* Knowing too much is bad and there’s no optimal answer and premature optimization is bad
* Consistency is better than anything
* Changes happen over time so be aware but also don’t hyper focus on small changes because that can be demoralizing especially if backslide 
    * Even if you aren't making strength improvements at the very least you are working to maintain your current progress and still being active and helping keep your body and mind healthy
* Don’t compare yourself to others a lot of it is genetics differences in time and money 
* Not every workout can be great but if you’re tired, do it tired you can even scale down work but it’s better than doing nothing and it helps keep the streak and better ingrain the habit over time 
* You don’t have to be sore after the workout that isn’t necessarily a sign that muscle growth won’t happen and also soreness means that you will need to rest more 
* Being stronger allows you to be more independent, happy, and healthy

## Exercise Science

* Straight versus pyramid sets don’t really affect muscle growth 
* Aim to lift heavy enough that the last 2–3 reps of each set are challenging
* Train close to failure 3-5 sets 
    * Whatever makes you feel like you're working your muscles is probably close to optimal
    * When pressing, pause to feel the stretch
    * Control the eccentric/negative because that is half the exercise
* There are diminishing marginal returns to working out more within a week
* Cardio doesn't hurt gains but it can be a hindrance to your recovery process and/or tire you out before your lifts
* People I've found useful for learning more science-based lifting:
    * Dr. Mike
    * Tyler Path
    * Jeff Nippard
