**What is sexual attraction?**

I believe in a Targeted Desire theory of sexual attraction.

> Sexual attraction is sexual desire targeted toward a specific person  
> \- *[Asexuality, Attraction, and Desire]({% post_url 2024-06-23-Asexuality,-Attraction,-and-Desire %})*

And I am particularly a proponent of a pleasure-centric conception of sexual attraction.

> A pleasure-centric view would look for desire for pleasure, when it comes about, and who it is targeted toward.  
> \- *[Asexuality and Sexual Desire/Pleasure]({% post_url 2025-06-14-Asexuality-and-Pleasure %})*

So putting it all together would be roughly something like sexual attraction is "desire for sexual pleasure with a specific person".

**How might this apply to someone in a relationship?**

In a relationship, you have a specific person that you may be engaging in sexual activity with, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you are attracted to them. But how?
* In one case, you simply do not enjoy/want to engage with them in sexual activity, but do so out of some other reason.
* In another case, you do enjoy sexual activity with them, but there is nothing in particular that roots this desire specifically to this person. It just so happens that they are there and in a monogamous relationship, they are the only person that you can do this with.
  * I know that this is a bit confusing and that it might unlock a new worry in some people. Ask yourself am I doing this *because* it is this person? This is what targeted desire is about.

**What if I started out with no attraction but now I do have it?**

This is almost exactly what [Demisexuality](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Demisexual) is all about.

I always identified and thought of myself more as Asexual before I realized that I am more close to Demisexual. I’m someone who becomes much more comfortable sexually after multiple safe encounters with someone. It's not something that is automatic, but something that just has to happen over time in a natural way.

**What if I started out attracted to someone but then it faded?**

Loss or gain of sexual attraction within a relationship does not necessarily imply A-Specness, but it can be a point of evidence to consider. 

There are a number of things that can generally affect your desire for pleasure (i.e. stress, depression, etc.). This does not mean that you become A-Spec during the times you are not experiencing this desire (read more about A-Spec here: [Ways of Being A-Spec]({% post_url 2024-11-27-Ways-of-Being-Aspec %})).
* Sexual attraction does change over time (Aceflux, Acespike, etc.) but can also be related to trauma, stress, medication, etc.
    * Sexual attraction is heavily connected to desire which means that these biological urges can be mediated by a lot of different factors

Something else that could be happening is an exit from the "honeymoon phase".
* One such reason could be a shift from spontaneous to responsive desire.
  * It is easy for early sexual desire in a relationship to be spontaneous because everything is so new and exciting, but that doesn't necessarily mean like it will be like that forever.

* I also think that if sexual chemistry is not totally there or under discussed a kind of burnout can happen that can only be resolved through dialogue.
  * Sex can be very performative which can make someone become more apprehensive about initiation over time. Especially if there is any kind of performance anxiety involved.
  * You might not like doing X and think that your partner really likes X but really they thought you liked X and was just going along with it. These are the kinds of things that are important to clear up so that everyone is having a good time.

**Why can't you just tell me if I'm A-Spec or not?**

No one can tell you if you are A-Spec or not! At the end of the day, you ultimately have to figure it out for yourself. There is no test to tell you with 100% certainty.

Sexuality is something that changes over time and you can adopt/shed labels as they suit you for better understanding yourself and communicating it others, but I wouldn't get too bogged down in it if it's causing you anxiety. Just introspect deeply over long periods of time, and if you are lucky enough to have someone who truly loves you, they will want to understand you and help you understand yourself.
