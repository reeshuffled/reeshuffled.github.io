digital can encode more information easier
* photo & video as memory
    * videos are better than pictures because they encode more information
        * you can encode thought via talking out loud while recording
        * vocal inflection will encode emotion in a way that writing cannot fully replicate
    * pictures don't capture the emotions or thoughts that you are feeling at the time
        * could combine pictures, videos, and voice memos into an apple note or some other document
* typing out thoughts and writing a journal are functionally the same, but carrying around a phone is easier
* are people still doing video diaries?
    * video blogging = vlogging is being done, but that's mostly as lifestyle vlogging as a way to make money and document life publicly in a more polished manner

thought as opposed to knowledge
* knowledge storage is a fairly solved problem with Personal Knowledge Storage Systems
    * Second Brains, Zettelkasten, etc.
* these knowledge management systems are about knowledge (information)
    * in a way its to provide value externally via knowledge work
        * giving people insights or connections of information (learning in public)
        * helps you recombine ideas for new projects and thinking (streamlining process)

how can you dump context (thought) onto a page for further processing later? 
* the more you can empty from your brain now means more processing power available for thinking of other stuff if your executive function allows you to table things
* the better you can situate your thoughts in context the less is lost when you pick back processing the train of thought later which minimizes the cost of the context switch and possibility of loss of potential thoughts from the first brainstorming session to the second one 
    * does the ability to reconstruct thought processes vary from person to person? is it a learnable skill?
* for bottom-up processors bullets are the easiest
    * bullet basic things (vague enough to move fast but specific enough so you don't forget what its about) and then build up from there
    * intense focus is needed and should probably be done in one sitting
