Do people use AI because they want to or have to?

* I’m someone who was forced to install it but never used it — but then used it out of curiosity and have now cautiously adopted it

Are some cultures more ready for AI?
* [Quick on their feed: What’s driving the ‘AI slop’ consumption surge in South Korea](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/quick-on-their-feed-whats-driving-the-ai-slop-consumption-surge-in-south-korea)

Is AI adoption higher in software engineering?
* [The State of AI in Software Engineering](https://www.harness.io/the-state-of-ai-in-software-engineering)
* Why is AI so good at coding? There is a lot of simple tasks that are done over and over again
* AI adoption is probably less so in creative fields

AI creates artifacts. If your job is the soulless creation of artifacts then it makes sense for you to use AI!
* Marketing and advertisement does not care about the creative.
* You are at a disadvantage in cost and time if you do not use AI. Especially in more competitive environments.
    * AI does not empower people with poor ability/discernment, but can be a multiplier for someone who is reasonably to very competent.
* However if you have AI reading and sending your emails, it really is AI just talking to each other.
    * Makes you think that we should instead rethink the system lol

If AI truly is a ubiquitous tool, then making personas doesn’t really make sense as much
* That would be like trying to do persona mapping on people who use smartphones that just doesn’t make sense to me
