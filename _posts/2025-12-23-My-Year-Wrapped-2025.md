## Overview

Welcome to my fourth installment of My Year Wrapped! You can read my previous articles here:
* [2024]({% post_url 2024-12-18-My-2024-Wrapped %})
* [2023]({% post_url 2024-01-02-My-2023-Wrapped %})
* [2022]({% post_url 2022-12-25-My-2022-Wrapped %})

I really lost my love of the game for tracking my time and quantifying my life, but I still do really like doing these articles because it forces to me to dig up old memories and confront what I actually did in the year. There are a lot of things that I just completely forget and in writing this article I am able to remember more of those things.

## Beer

Untappd Recappd kind of annoys me because the structure changes so much year to year that I don't have consistent metrics to compare over time. I could get a membership to download the data to do it myself, but I'm too lazy to right now.

313 beers as compared to 424 last year, -26.2% change.

55 styles, which is supposedly 9 less than last year, -14.1% change.

I definitely still enjoy beer and seek it out when I am traveling or around good beer shops, but otherwise I do not really reach for it all that much, and I think my statistics reflect that. I also just went to less breweries this year which certainly accounts for the numeric difference as well.

## Hosting

I hosted 9 times last year so I’m not that far off this year. 
* I didn’t host for my birthday so that is a main difference and counts for some of the loss.
* Had an 8th event planned but had to cancel for sickness.
* I have definitely enjoyed hosting less, but I think that is because I was doing mostly large events and that it was mostly the same people attending each time. I do love getting to see people that I don't see often at my events, but I do think that I like injection of new energy and formation of new relationships through my events.
    * I think that next year I am going to experiment with smaller events and see how that goes.

Events:
1. Crafting Circle (January)
2. [Cocktail Mixer]({% post_url 2025-03-26-Cocktail-Mixer-Event %}) (February, Co-Hosted)
3. I Can’t Believe It’s not Lunch (March, Co-Hosted)

5. Hawaiian Happy Hour (June, Co-Hosted)
6. Falling Into Fall (September, Co-Hosted)
7. Spooky Halloween Kickback (October, Co-Hosted)

## Home Updates

I did a lot in the first half of the year but slowed down as the year progressed. I am now pretty much done with my apartment. There is still some room for improvement

## Books

To me this has felt like my best year of reading in terms of variety, enjoyment, and number of books. I usually try to read 1:1 fiction to non-fiction, but this year I definitely read more fiction and that is almost certainly why I have read more books this year. I really do like non-fiction but because it can be dry it will of course be less engaging than a fictional story.

I really got into Danish translated fiction like On the Calculation of Volume and The Employees.

## Anime

Average of 12 Episodes per Show x 45 shows x 22 minutes = 11880 minutes / 60 minutes = 198 hours / 11 months = 18 hours/month / 7 days = 4.5 hours/week

These are only shows that I’ve completed, there are a few I watch 1-5 episodes of before I drop in the middle of it.

Anime really doesn’t stick with me all that much. This is a lot more of a way to pass the time. I enjoy the shows in the moment but it’s kind of like a meal or snack where I don’t exactly remember how it impacted me or all the ways I liked it. I take less time to savor it than a book or movie. I often will watch anime in 2x speed as well.
