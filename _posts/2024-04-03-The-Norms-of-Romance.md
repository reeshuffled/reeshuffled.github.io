Relationship Escalator (you move on from one step to the other in a linear progression):
1. You date non-exclusively
2. You date exclusively
3. You get married (can move in before or after)
4. You buy a house together
5. You have kids

[read more on the relationship escalator](https://offescalator.com/what-escalator/)

the relationship escalator has changed a little bit over time, but not all that much
* there might be slight deviation in the order but people are generally expected to follow it linearly
* within each piece of the relationship escalator are norms/expectations for people in those roles

Norms on who you can marry
* Same race - outdated but still racism
* Same class - still kicking but not as explicit
* Opposite sex - outdated but still homophobia
* Only one person - Monogamy is still strongly held but polyamory is gaining traction

Norms of what you do when married
* Move in together - almost no discourse in opposition
* Buy a house together - small opposing voices about buying vs renting
    * Sleep in the same bed/share a bedroom - small alternative voices
* Share finances - some opposing voices
* Have kids - some empowerment for DINKs
