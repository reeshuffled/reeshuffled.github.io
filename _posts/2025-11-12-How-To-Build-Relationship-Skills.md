  relationships better and deeper.

## Background

These are skills that aren't just romantic; they are necessary for any close relationship. This is because relationship skills at the end of the day are just interpersonal skills. They will help you have better familial, professional, platonic, and romantic relationships.

A common thing I hear is that someone needs to be alone (i.e. not in a relationship) in order to better themselves in order to be a better partner in a relationship. While there are certainly times that this is true, I believe that a lot of these skills must be practiced in the context of a relationship. However if you don't want to "blow it" or practice with the fear of losing a romantic partner you can try bringing it into your longer friendships.

None of this will be revolutionary, but my hope is that by creating a centralized list that people can chart their progress and see in what ways they may need to improve to have better relationships.

I have linked a number of resources for most of the skills that I have listed, but I recommend that you also do your own research and dig deeper into things that you think you might need to work on. You may also need to go to therapy or other professional help to better develop some of these skills or help identify blind spots.

## Things to Understand about Love and Relationships

Beyond just interpersonal skills I think there are some core beliefs you need/should have about love and relationships that are a strong base to motivate the acquisition of certain skills.

* Love is about seeing and being seen. 
    * No one can read your mind. 
    * You can’t get mad at someone if you haven’t communicated the failure and success criteria.
        * Assume that there is no such thing as common knowledge.
* It’s not how much we share or care, but how much we repair. 
* Love isn’t easy, but it is simple. 
* Love is a choice not a feeling.
* Love is care.
* Blind loyalty to your partner is not love.
