## Background

I made 80 posts this year! A veritable mix of lists, articles, and stubs that crossed a variety of different topics. As I counted, over 60 of them were pretty easily clumped into categories. While these categories do not encompass all the posts I made this year, I do think that it is an interesting and useful exercise to try to group together like articles to see what was on my mind the most this year.

I could have written a small program to generate links for all the articles, but I was too lazy, so if you see an article that is interesting you'll just have to find it on the "All" Writing page.

I will list the topics in order to most to least posts.
