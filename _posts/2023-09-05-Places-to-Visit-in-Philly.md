Philadelphia is one of my favorite U.S. cities and there is a variety of things to do, see, and eat/drink. As a craft beer fan, I am especially partial to the breweries that are in the city of Philly. This list is the result of numerous trips to Philly, but I will the be the first to admit that I've only begun to scratch the surface of what the diverse city has to offer.

## Shopping
* [Bookhaven](https://www.instagram.com/bookhaven_philly/)
    * A used bookstore with an incredibly extensive collection in all categories
    * Prices are a bit pricer than other used bookstores, but most if not all books are in great condition

## Food
* [Cleavers](https://www.cleaversphilly.com/)
    * Good sandwiches and fries
* [Silk City](https://www.silkcityphilly.com/)
    * Small diner menu but really good food
    * Liked the breakfast sandwich a lot, omlettes were huge
* [Angelo’s Pizza](https://angelospizzeriasouthphiladelphia.com/)
    * Really good pizza, cash only though and no delivery    
* [El Merkury](https://www.elmerkury.com/)
    * Kinda expensive for churros, but have interesting flavors

## Coffee
* [OCF Coffee House](https://www.ocfrealty.com/ocf-coffee-house/)
    * Good coffee and serviceable food
    * Fairmount location has a beautiful interior, great for working
* [Cambridge St Coffee House](https://www.cambridgestcoffeehouse.com/)
    * Food is pretty good, if on the more expensive side
    * Wide of variety of Monin syrups to add to your coffee
    * I feel like the drink sizes were quite large, but great prices

## Breweries/Beer
* [Triple Bottom Brewing](https://triplebottombrewing.com/)
    * Really cute spot that has a smaller list of beers but they are pretty decent in quality
    * Right near Love City and Liquid Art (other breweries)
* [Tapster](https://tapstertastingroom.com/sublocation/philadelphia/)
    * Self-serve tap house with beer, wine, cocktails, coffee, kombucha, and even root beer
    * Fun seating areas with swings and stools
    * Serve snacks and then also other food in partnership with a nearby restaurant
* [Liquid Art Barrel House](https://liquidartbarrelhouse.com/)
    * The beer is fairly good, lots of lower ABV stuff and a good amount of sours
    * The food is really good, pretzel bun burger especially
    * Got really busy around 7 when we went
* [Other Half Brewing](https://otherhalfbrewing.com/location/philadelphia/)
    * They have a very new school IPA heavy menu, but they are one of the best breweries nationally
    * Lots of indoor and outdoor seating available
* [City Tap](https://www.citytap.com/location/city-tap-house-logan-square/)
    * This is technically more a restaurant than a beer bar, but have a good selection
    * Can get small pours of beer which is always better for the wallet
    * Food was quite good, recommend the burger and/or cheesesteak

## Bars/Nightlife
* [Locust Rendezvous](https://locustrendezvous.com/)
    * Nice dive bar with serviceable food 
* [Franky Bradley’s](https://frankybradleys.com/)
    * Happy hour deals were pretty good
    * Loaded fries were yummy
    * Decent beer and cocktail menu
* [Concourse Dance Bar](https://www.concoursedancebar.com/)
    * Cheaper cover than Woody’s
    * Music is fine much more electronic/pop leaning than rap
    * They have a ball pit that you can go in
* [Morgan’s Pier](https://www.morganspier.com/)
    * Has cover and is really crowded, but a fun time for dancing
    * By the water
