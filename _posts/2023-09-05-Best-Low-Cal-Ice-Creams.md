Very Good:
1. Halo Top Strawberry Sorbet
2. Halo Top Mango Sorbet

Pretty Good:
1. Nick’s Emerald Minta
    * Peppermint-y flavor 
    * Good creamy texture
    * Has a bit of an artificial aftertaste but not in a bad way
    * Peppermint crunchies
2. Favorite Day Mocha Cold Brew Coffee
    * A bit icy but otherwise good texture
    * not super strong coffee flavor but still nice cookie swirl adds nice crunchy gritty texture 
3. Nick’s Strawberry Swirl
    * Icy
    * Artificial but good strawberry flavor
    * Strawberry swirl is kinda jellied but chewy
4. Enlightened Brownies & Cookie Dough Frozen Greek Yogurt
    * Nice chocolate flavor
    * Crunchy chocolate chips and chewy dough bites make for fun texture
    * Not creamy but it’s skim milk but decent texture 

Alright:
1. Enlightened Caramel Fudge Pretzel
    * Pretzel saltiness and texture adds a lot, don’t really get the fudge though
    * Base ice cream is eh
2. Enlightened Mint Chocolate Chunk
    * More Keto than Low-Cal because it’s cream but no added sugar
    * Decent mint flavor but definitely can taste the no sweetness
    * Chocolate has nice crunch

Didn’t Hit:
1. Halo Top Strawberry Ice Cream
    * Tasted freezer burnt, artificial strawberry flavor 
    * Decent texture for low fat
