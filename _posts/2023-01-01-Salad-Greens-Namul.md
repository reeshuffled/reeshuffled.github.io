Namul (나물 in Korean), according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namul), “refers to either a variety of edible grass or leaves or seasoned herbal dishes made of them”. Namul is a common Korean side dish (banchan) where basically any kind of vegetable or green can be used. Typically the green is blanched as a part of the preparation, but I don’t like how you have to put the green in an ice bath afterward, making the dish kinda soggy and cold, even after just shocking it and squeezing the moisture out. Hence I created this lazier version of namul, using ingredients that often people have a small amount of left over from their giant salad box/bag.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup salad greens
- 2 Tbsp of neutral oil
- 4 cloves garlic
- 4 scallions
- 1 Tbsp of sesame oil
- Pinch of salt (flaky preferred)

**Instructions:**
1. Heat up oil over medium-high heat.
2. Cut the garlic into slices and cut the white bottom part of the scallions off and fry in the oil to infuse for about one minute.
3. Cut the green part of the scallion in half and cut along the length into strips and add to your salad greens.
4. Pour your salad greens and sliced scallions into the pan and fry until wilted. Turn up the heat briefly toward the end if you want to get some char on the vegetables.
5. Pour everything into a bowl and drizzle sesame oil and salt on top of the vegetable mixture.
