Things
* Consumables
    * Alcohol, snacks, etc.
* Hobby/Interest Related Items
* Elevated Items
    * Items that they might already have, but in a higher quality
* Something that they need/want, but wouldn't buy themselves

Non-Things
* Experiences
    * Concert Tickets
    * Vacation/Trip
* Charitable Donation
* [Cash]({% post_url 2024-12-02-Cash-As-A-Gift %})
* No Gift
    * As long as you talk it out with the person, I think that it can be acceptable to not give a gift to someone for whatever occasion for whatever reason. However, it is with the general understanding that you want to give a gift and that if you find something that they want, you would get it for them.
