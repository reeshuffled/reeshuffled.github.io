I think that this film was philosophically rich as a narrative and will only become more relevant as time goes on.
* The play was written in 2015 and this movie in 2017, far before OpenAI released ChatGPT.

## Ideas Explored

The fallibility and malleability of memory and narrative:
* Changing the proposal story to Casablanca 
    * later the memory was shown to be modified already
* "The story was like a fairy tale"
    * Calling out that we turn our memories into stories when we tell them and make embellishments over time
* William James and the memory of memory
* Memory and conflicting accounts 
* Recollection and telling stories to others as a way to communicate and share memory 
* Storytelling and confessional
* The bias of memory: we might only remember the good things
* “Remember when…” as a conversation topic 

AI Companionship and Holograms:
* Interesting they chose a hologram most likely as a metaphor for it being a lackluster representation/inherently artificial 
* "Real" bodies would be the ultimate frontier for physical presence
* Sometimes people just want to talk and sometimes people just want to be listened to or listen 
* Would people be too accepting or not accepting enough of the hologram? (Uncanny Valley)
* AI and approaching human-like conversation
    * feigning ignorance (when to search something up versus not)
    * promising and other speech acts
* With corporations this is just surveillance, and they absolutely couldn’t be trusted with this much data.

Family Care Work:
* Jealousy of companions from family 
* Worry without empathy from the family because of the burden of care and the grieving of the slow death 
* Overprotectiveness and infantalization
    * "She isn’t an infant to be pacified" "But what’s wrong with being pacified?"
        * I think that Primes are only for deceased family members (ostensibly) it doesn't seem too bad as opposed to just being able to recreate anyone.
* The daughter’s unwillingness to go along with her mother’s delusions
    * aging, dementia, irritability
    * with dementia patients it’s often better to go along with their delusions 
* Firm dictations of care and the infighting it causes by others that care in the family 
* The splitting of work depending on next of kin and overall competence and care 

Death:
* We can carry on memory, and create new memories with the Primes but at the end of the day they are more like parrots
* What's stopping everyone from having their own Prime in this world?
* When is too early to have a Prime? Does it arrest the grieving process? Help it?
* How would this affect religion in this world?

## Technical

* Color is a bit flat 
* I loved the shooting location
    * Architecture is nice 
    * I like how it’s mostly one location i actually wish they didn’t have the bar scene
* The futuristic phone prop kind of ruined my immersion because I don't think it looked good.
* Camera work ain’t too bad
    * Some nice camera movement zooms pans etc
    * Good usage of close ups
* Lighting is generally good 
* Editing
    * Mostly fade scene transitions
    * I liked the minimal sound design and score
        * Mostly silent except for the waves and conversation
        * The violin score because she liked playing? Diagetic music because Marjorie asked for it.
* Some good shots
    * Shots to nothing where hologram was is good
    * Nice low light shots

## Narrative

* All the character's dying off screen makes more sense to me when i learned that it was originally a play
* I don’t think there’s too much tell in here good callbacks to itself, they never outright blurt out what happened
    * I do think that talking about William James and memory was laying it on a bit too thick, but other than that I think they mostly left the view to reflect on things themselves.
* I think that symbolically Toni and Toni Two are a mirror for the Primes.
    * The signififer and the signified start to blur when the signifier is the same.
* I liked seeing how each person interacts with the Primes differently.
    * It was interesting to see john understand what Tess was saying about the Primes when he has to talk to someone he was more close with.
        * “I’m just talking to myself” are you?
        * He uses Walter Prime almost as a confessional at times, whereas he is more reserved with Tess Prime (understandably so).
    * It was interesting to see what people pick as the appearance of the Prime.
* Themes:
    * Grief
    * Memory
    * Family
    * Care
    * Aging And Death 
    * Love
