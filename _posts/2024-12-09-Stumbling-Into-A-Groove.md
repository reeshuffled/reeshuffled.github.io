## Did I find my groove this year?

My [Word of the Year for 2024 was "Groove"]({% post_url 2024-01-05-Finding-My-Groove-in-2024 %}). It was always a kind of nebulous goal, but I think that what I was really looking for was some kind of feeling that I was doing the right things week to week. I think that overall I achieved this goal, but it kind of happened by accident.

The early and middle parts of this year hit me pretty hard, which led me to write an article about [my “funk”]({% post_url 2024-06-05-Groove-or-Funk? %}). In essence, I felt guilty for neglecting certain parts of my goals and how I didn’t have a good routine. I wanted to reframe how I looked at these things and I ultimately came to the conclusion that my energies were just being put elsewhere and that I shouldn’t feel bad about how my energy is being expended as long as I am still trying to grow and improve myself. 

I’m glad I have the mid-year reflection article because otherwise I’m not sure if I would have remembered how I was feeling at that point. It honestly feels like a totally different years of my life and like I was a completely different person.

## What got me out of my funk?

I think that individually each of these things wouldn't have been enough to get me out of my funk, but a lot of them led into each other/worked synergistically to give me more energy to accomplish the things I wanted. As I mentioned before, these factors weren't really aimed at trying to get me out of my funk, rather they were just the natural progression of things already happening in my life.

I gained better routine and more energy:  
1. I got more seriously into lifting and personal health
    * I started lifting and consumed Science-Based Lifting content (late June to start of July)
        * TikTok really helped my fitness journey
    * Started some supplements: Protein powder (August), Electrolytes (October), Creatine (November)
    * I feel so much better physically and it’s fun to feel yourself getting stronger.
    * Working out everyday (if not lifting, cardio) has helped structure my days because I know that I want to work out each day. If I accomplish nothing else that day as long as I exercised I feel pretty good.
2. I switched teams at work
    * The work is more interesting and I have more long-term projects to do on this team. This means that I have more things to do during the day and feel more fulfilled by the work I'm doing which has definitely helped my energy levels.
        * I definitely feel more drain when I am bored and don't have a lot of things to do during the day.

I had more fulfilling social interactions and relationships:
1. I started dating more seriously with an [abundance mindset]({% post_url 2024-11-06-Online-Dating-From-An-Abundance-Mindset %}) which allowed me to meet new people and experience new things
    * When I first started Hinge, I was honestly too scared to talk to people and/or meet up with them, so I mostly just swiped and matched with a few people here and there. It wasn’t until I decided to start having fun with it and not really care about the results too much that I was able to start matching and meeting up with people who felt more aligned with me.
    * Dating, [while not easy]({% post_url 2024-11-28-Difficulties-in-Non-Traditional-Dating %}), has still been a lot of fun and exposed me to a lot of new experiences that I probably otherwise wouldn’t have gotten.
2. Meeting new friends and hosting more allowed me to solidify my community and strengthen my relationships to people
    * I feel like I met a lot of new people this year while also deepening my other friendships by hosting and introducing them to other people.
    * I am particularly proud of the fact that I hosted every month from July-December except for October. 
        * I really enjoy hosting but it can be a lot of mental effort to plan, coordinate, invite people, and actually have the event. Having a co-host for some of my events has really helped take the some of the burden off it.

## Reflection on Sub-Goals

I won’t even really do this because I feel like in light of everything else it feels trite, but I do want to do it just for consistency's sake.

1. Plan meals better
    * I didn't do this, but I Feel less bad about it. I have a few frozen/pantry meals that I can go to if I'm hungry and don't wanna cook, or have protein bars for a quick snack. When I want to cook, I'll cook, but usually I don't want to as much and that's okay.
2. Do an arts & crafts hobby
    * I made some stamp art and tried to do a gallery wall and take more photos this year. I think reframing interior design as an artistic practice has given me more creative fulfillment.
    * I definitely still want to be more creative next year but not sure if I will have an emphasis on tangible, physical objects/art
3. Make less impulsive purchases
    * I did a pretty good job for the most part I think, but then Christmas came around and it did feel like I was spending so much money. I think maybe I should just budget instead of trying to focus on reducing impulsive purchases.
4. Learn, think, and write more
    * I read far more than I did last year and I wrote a bunch of articles this year that I am really proud of, so I would say that this was a smashing success.
5. Listen to more music
    * I discovered a lot of new music this year as I got more into Skramz and while I don't think I discovered many new artists outside of genres that I wasn't already listening to, I am still happy with the music that I listened to this year.
6. Leave the apartment more
    * It now feels like staying at my apartment is "having a night in" rather than it being the default, which I think speaks volumes about how well I accomplished this goal.
    * I think this will always be in the back of my mind, but I don't think I'll have it as an explicit goal again.
