It probably won't come as a surprise to you, but I don't believe in soulmates. Supposedly 60% of the United States believes in soulmates ([Source](https://ifstudies.org/blog/soulmate-marriage-vs-the-only-one-marriage-knowing-the-difference-matters)). The [myth of the soulmate supposedly comes from Ancient Greece](https://www.greecehighdefinition.com/blog/the-greek-myth-of-soulmates) and pervades much of the current mythos of romantic love in society today.

Longing for wholeness is one thing but to seek it in another person is another
* the desire to feel complete to me that is wanting to know yourself and have your shortcomings be neutralized but you can do that too it just takes inner work
* i think [longing for wholeness is a Christian value](https://www.faithandhealthconnection.org/the_connection/spirit-soul-and-body/wholeness-biblical-and-christian-perspective/) that has then seeped into the concept of romance

I think that your partner should complement you, not complete you
* Your partner core values should match up that isn’t completeness but being in same page 
* You and your partner shouldn't be the exact same
    * You should have some different interests or path in life so that you can teach and learn things to continue growing as people
    * In some ways having an introverted and extroverted partner is helpful but opposites can lead to clashing but having a determined and lazy partner could be helpful if resentment doesn’t build or death by a thousand paper cuts
* Completion implies that you are imperfect without another person
* Another person cannot give your life meaning implicitly, that comes with the idea of devoting your life to that person as your own decision that imbues your life with meaning
