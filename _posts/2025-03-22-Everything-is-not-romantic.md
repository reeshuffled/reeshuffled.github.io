[Everything is romantic by Charli xcx](https://genius.com/Charli-xcx-everything-is-romantic-lyrics) or is it?

Romance originally refers to 'Roman-ish' as in the romance languages like Spanish, French, and Italian.

Now we romanticize our lives and pursue romantic relationships with other people
* The idea of [romance as sweeping feelings comes from literary tradition](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/kiiws4/comment/ggsq8sw)

If our relationship with our friends are more intimate than "normal", we might call it romantic or resembling romance, but why is this the term that we must reach for? I strive for a time where we don't have to invoke this concept to convey the depth of the connection.
