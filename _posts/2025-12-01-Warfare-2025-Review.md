description: A platoon of American Navy SEALs on a surveillance mission gone wrong
  in insurgent territory. A boots-on-the-ground story of modern warfare and brotherhood,
  told in real time and based on the memory of the people who lived it.

with this movie being focused on a realistic portrayal of just one military engagement the focus is not on the general war and interrogations on the justness of it
* civilian involvement is given a bit of thought while not the main focus
    * showing how it affects locals and destroy lives and property even if they aren't acting as soldiers in the war

i think that the honest portrayal of war will resonate differently with everyone depending on their preconceptions 
* to me, it is gruesome and traumatic and messy portrayal but in a way that reads to me like it is not trying to glorify or fetishize it
    * a bit one note of "war is hell" but it is better than other lenses I suppose
* i don't think they are necessarily painted as heroes
    * since the subjects are living/real people a base level of respect is given to them in their own story
    * but they aren't painted as courageous heroes in my opinion
        * they make the local soldiers go out first to open the tank doors and then send the first Seal out after the locals come back safely
        * they make mistakes and are traumatized by the actions that play out

masculinity as a theme:
* brotherhood a bit but not as much as it was marketed as
* being called weak when the guy filling in as sniper didn't take the shot
* opening scene is all the guys watching a racy exercise video together
* the soldier from the other unit not really taking the casualties seriously and trying to give a severely out of touch pep talk to the wounded

it was well produced with good cinematography and sound design and while not super artistic still had some good artistic choices
* i liked how audio and talking would overlap sometimes
* i enjoyed when in some scenes there was no sound at all

with all that being said why this movie and why now? 
* i think it is strange on garland and a24’s part to make and distribute this movie
* maybe as a cautionary tale for war but it doesn’t seem as important as other stories in this moment
