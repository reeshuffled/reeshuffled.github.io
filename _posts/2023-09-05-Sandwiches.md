Sandwiches are one of the best types of food because they are so versatile, and there are different times and places for sandwiches. For example, a ham and cheese sandwich with Doritos has to be enjoyed at the pool or a beach.

1. Cheesesteak
    * Fried Onions, Hots, Mayo
2. Fried Chicken Sandwich
3. Italian Cold Cut 
    * I can't have Mortadella because it has pistachios
4. Cuban
5. Reuben
6. BLT 
    * Sometimes with Avocado and/or Turkey
7. Bacon Cheeseburger    
    * I do love burgers, but I am not always in the mood for burgers, hence the lower spot
    * Smashburgers are the best, but otherwise a burger cooked Medium will do as well
    * Pickles are a must, I usually add lettuce and tomato as well
8. Bacon, Egg, and Cheese
    * I don't really like English muffins, but on a Plain Bagel or Croissant
9. Chicken Parmesan Sub
10. Meatball Sub
    * Never seems to have any kind of structural integrity, but I still love it
