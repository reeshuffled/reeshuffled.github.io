I've [previously written about living alone]({% post_url 2023-06-27-Lessons-Learned-Living-Alone %}), but that primarily focused on things that I had learned from living alone/sharing my personal experience. In this article I want to focus more on giving practical advice to people who are looking to live alone or already are doing so. 

I said this in the last article, but I think it bears repeating: I think that everyone can learn something and grow by living alone, but I don’t think that everyone is the right type of person to be able to live by themself, for any number of reasons. Additionally, I know that it is a privilege to be able to live alone, and not one that should be taken for granted.

1. Liven up the place: even though you live alone your home doesn’t have to be dead
    * Break the silence with music, podcasts, TV, etc.
        * Listen to music from radio, NTS, YouTube DJ sets, playlists, vinyl, etc.
        * Listen to podcasts (or watch video podcasts)
        * Watch live TV (digital antenna or cheap streaming app), 
        * Get a nice speaker and play music from records/CDs or just from your phone
    * Get plants or a pet
        * Both take responsibility but you should especially not jump blindly into getting a pet just because you're lonely
    * Surround yourself with decor (objects, art, etc.) that makes you happy
2. Plan your socialization: even if you are an introvert you really should get small human interactions
    * For small stakes interactions go to a store or somewhere with a predictable social script
    * Plan lunch or dinner meetings with friends and family that are close by
    * If you don't want to leave the house you can always call a friend or play online games with people
3. Get out of the house!
    * Go to in person activities near by (by yourself or with others)
    * Study, read, work, or hang out in other places like cafes, bars, or libraries
    * Go on a walk or find a gym that allows you to have somewhere to go other than your house on a regular basis
4. Take advantage of what living alone has to offer you
    * Dance because nobody's watching
    * Laugh or cry loudly at movies or talk out loud during them
    * Host people/dinners/parties/sleepovers
    * Play your own music or podcasts out loud instead of using headphones
    * Leave things out if you stop in the middle of a task and resume it later
