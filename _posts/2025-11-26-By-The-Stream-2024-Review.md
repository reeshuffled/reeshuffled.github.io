hong hallmarks:
* drinking of course but also lots of eating
* it is about time in a way since he is coming back to the same university 40 years later to also make a skit
* characters in film

themes/motifs:
* a movie about becoming, starting over, self-actualization
* a lot of moon shots too / the prof and uncle were moon watching as well

camera work:
* hearing before seeing
* letting the scene breathe a little bit before any action and also lets the shot linger
* things happen off screen
* cuts are a bit jarring sometimes but then he lets the shot breathe 
* nice panning shots
* there are some real pretty shots in here (like her playing with the leaf)
* camera moves or zooms sometimes but mostly stationary (maybe as not to detract from dialogue)
* never too many people in the frame at once — especially not talking
* lots of dark to light shots or just low light in general 

random thoughts:
* hong sang soo is an artist’s artist 
    * character is an actor
    * character is an artist and professor
* this work isn’t challenging but also not the most engaging/attention grabbing so i found myself watching it in little pieces throughout the day
* i feel like he knows how to stick an ending
* the camera felt so loving at the end
    * It felt similar to the ending of the Novelist's film as well
    * This could just be me projecting since I know that they're married in real life
* i wish i saw more/understood the skit better
    * i love meta-theater/acting
