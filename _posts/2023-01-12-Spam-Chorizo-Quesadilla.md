Spam is a kitchen staple in many Asian countries (probably others places too where the American military had a prolonged presence). I like Spam, just not really the taste, so I always try to season it heavily. I think that it takes to seasonings very well, and I thought that I would try to turn this Spam into another delicious pork product, chorizo. I think that this yields something amazing that you can put in quesadilla, over eggs, rice, etc, it is so versatile.

**Spam Chorizo Ingredients:**
* 1 can of Spam
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 Tbsp Paprika
* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder
* 1 Tbsp Onion Powder
* 1/2 Tbsp Chili Powder
* 1 Tbsp Crushed Red Pepper
* 1 Tbsp Cumin
* 1/2 Tbsp Italian Seasoning
* 1 tsp Black Pepper

**Quesadilla Ingredients:**
* 2 tortillas
* Mexican cheese blend

**Crema Ingredients:**
* 2 Tbsp sour cream
* 1 Tbsp hot sauce

**Instructions:**
1. Grate the Spam with a cheese grater.
2. Cut the garlic into thin slices. 
3. Put over Spam medium heat and let a bit of fat render out before putting in garlic slices. Wait a bit longer and add all the spices. 
4. Cook for about 15-20 minutes or until crispy, stirring often. Take out the Spam chorizo and put it in a container to rest.
5. Oil/butter your pan, then place a tortilla down. 
6. Layer cheese and the spam chorizo and place the other tortilla on top, pressing down hard in order to compress the cheese.
7. Flip after a minute and half or when the tortilla has browned.
8. While the quesadilla is cooking, combine the sour cream and hot sauce together to create the spicy crema.
9. Once the other tortilla is browned as well, the quesadilla is ready to be served. Slice it up and dip it into the crema to eat it.
