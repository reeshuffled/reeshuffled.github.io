equating romance with desire is bad
* relationships are a choice
* desire fades
    * 7 year itch
* the advice to be constantly dating your partner is interesting because it’s to keep it new and exciting and to keep desire rooted to one person—this is markedly different than just suggesting quality time together, that’s just the basis of a normal relationship
* someone you marry should be your best friend seems like the better goal
* now you have to maintain romance + a friendship for a partnership that’s two things as opposed to partnering with your friend which is just a friendship 
    * for an emotional fulfilling partnership that is, a business like partner ship where both parties practical needs are met is conceivable as well
