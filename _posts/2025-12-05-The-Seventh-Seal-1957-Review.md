## Technique

Pacing-wise it started rather slow and I almost dropped it but I am glad that I stuck it out because I really enjoyed this movie. I think that because of my Catholic background I was able to really resonate with Block and his doubts about religion.

The craft of the movie was of course beautiful.
* There were a lot of striking shots
* Because of the black and white there were some beautifully lit scenes that had all the much more impact
* I liked the dissolves, sometimes multiple in quick succession
* While it did follow an arc, I wouldn't say there was much of a story, mostly little moments to inspire emotions
* good sound design 
    * Although I did find it strange that there wasn't really much foley sound
    * Dramatic orchestral score that seemed very much of the time, but I enjoyed it
* Good blocking 
    * face to camera shots felt dissonant to me, but I did enjoy the monologuing

## Themes and Motifs

The parts about faith and religion were very profound. I wouldn't say that they were entirely novel because they did echo a lot of thoughts I had before so it was cool to see them explored on screen.

Coexistence of tragedy and levity:
* While I wouldn't say that this movie was overly funny, there were some lighter comedic moments to balance out a lot of the tragedy that was happening during the film.

Religion:
* the silence of God
* the crusades
* faith and dogma
* religion as a business (the painter talking about the symbiotic relationship between his art and the church)
* the spirituality of the fool (can see demons, angels, death, etc.)

Death:
* fear of death and religion
    * Block praying to God as Death takes him at the end
* the fear of death as fear of the unknown 
* death as the frustration of projects (the director)
* everything seems meaningless in front of death (cancelled on account of being dead)
* death and dignity 
    * bargaining (playing chess, begging for life, etc.)
    * the man dying alone with no reassurance from the plague because he was wicked
* life after death (squirrel on tree after death cuts it down)

Life and Humanity:
* the kindness of humans (the sharing of the milk and strawberries)
* life and sex and pleasure (the director running away with the woman)
* cruelty of humanity and cowardice (the man who convinced the Knight and Squire to go on the Crusade)
* music, dance, and creation (everyone is writing songs??)
* milk and strawberries as life and nature

The black plague and the end of times:
* the self-flagellating doomsday cult
* the man in the bar saying that it's the end of times
* People seemed somewhat casual about it because they were probably ignorant or felt like it wouldn't reach them

There were a lot of misogynistic bits and I don't know enough about Bergman to know if it’s just a result of the characters. But even then, not sure what statement is trying to be made.
* the burning of the witch (they do try to help her though)
* saving the woman from rape (but then still forces her to labor)
* a lot of dialogue with the vibe of "can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em"
* the duplicitous smith's wife and how it's played
