Long-Term Alignment: Goals, future, etc.
* "Core Beliefs"

Daily Life Alignment: How you spend your day, communication, etc.
* Character, neurotype, routines
* Daily life rhythm/biorhythm compatibility
    * Waking hours
    * Morning and night routines
    * When you eat meals/get hungry

Is one more preferable than the other?
* They are related
    * Long term alignment certainly doesn’t entail daily life alignment 
        * It isn’t the case that you just can work backward from long term goals and make your daily lives align
    * How we live our days is how we live our lives, so daily alignment somewhat morphs into long-term alignment.
* Non-long-term alignment is a bit of a non-starter (because why invest in a relationship that is destined to be unaligned), but also what is the point of the long term with someone if the days aren’t fulfilling (non-daily aligned)?
* If the days are fulfilling and you like the other person but the end is doomed then it can make sense in the short to medium term but yeah that doesn’t really make sense in the long run
    * But I think it could be beneficial to stay in that rather than try to build with someone else 
    * You will also be at the mercy of who is available at that time, you may miss out on some people if you are aware of it, but otherwise you will also find different people who are available at a later time
* Some things are not so easily sorted into daily vs long-term so sometimes a trait can be looked through both lenses.

How much do people change? How much change can you expect your partner to do for you? When is the right time to leave?
* I think that people do change, but that there needs to be an inciting event. If they could have changed the whole time and didn't then they didn't want to. Nothing changes if nothing changes.
* Do people change? Well yes, but not everything
    * There are things that you can’t really change about a person
        * You can habituate them to think about how the other person may feel (to be considerate about something that is different than themself), but that’s about it
    * If someone likes something about themself then they don’t have much incentive to change it — and who are you to tell someone to change something that they like about themself for you?

Risk appetite, uncertainty tolerance, task/deadline urgency, desire for connection
* Risk tolerance

What is compatibility versus alignment? Is alignment part of compatibility? Is compatibility alignment?
* Most people would agree that core values should be shared/aligned for a good relationship. 
* Similarly long-term goals like getting married or having children should also be shared/aligned. 
* Ex: If someone has time anxiety and the other time blindness this is day to day incompatibility—not really misalignment.
* I think that alignment is a part of compatibility.
    * I think if you are aligned in both ways, you are probably compatible (unless you don't like each other).
    * If you are aligned in long but not daily, you probably aren't as compatible.
    * If you are aligned in the daily but not long you probably aren't compatible or compatibility is quite low.
