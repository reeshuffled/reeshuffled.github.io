title: 'A Pigeon Sat On A Branch Reflecting On Existence (2014): Review'
slug: a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-review
description: An absurdist, surrealistic and shocking pitch-black comedy, which moves
  freely from nightmare to fantasy to hilariously deadpan humour as it muses on man’s
  perpetual inhumanity to man.

A film rich in style:
* drab colors
* depth in frame and dynamic backgrounds 
* fixed camera one shot scenes
* doors and windows or mirrors
* [It's Not Easy Being Human – The Living Paintings of Roy Andersson \| Film Qualia on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLCtJkGKefU)
* [The Magnificent Anders(s)ons - The Look of Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUEVSNMdYLA)

Repetition:
* The sales pitch 
* “I’m happy to hear you're doing fine”
* Battlefield hymn of the republic 
    * [That war-chant in "A pigeon sat on a branch reflecting on existence" \| r/TrueFilm](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/612bmg/that_warchant_in_a_pigeon_sat_on_a_branch/)
* One sided phone calls 

Tone: eerie, uncomfortable, awkward/cringe

Usage of Humor:
* This movie is funny, but in a heady way that doesn't produce any huge laughter (at least in my experience).
    * This is a real study in absurdity and how just incongruity can provide some spontaneous laughter but that anticipation really does a lot of the heavy lifting in humor.
* Deadpan surrealist nordic humor = whimsy??
* I think the absurd/surreal is definitely to showcase the inherent absurdity of life.
    * "You can't feel the day of the week"

Contrast:
* The miserable novelty toy salesmen is a good humorous contrast.
* “i’m happy to hear you doing fine” and all the different contexts it could be said
* charles xii and current time
* the main characters mostly experience misfortune but then in the vignettes:
    * little moments of beauty; helping an old man put a coat on, little girls blowing bubbles, a mother playing with her baby
    * the vignettes don’t really follow the style of the movie they seem almost outside of it

I do think that some things are played purely for shock value.
* Animal cruelty
* Sexual assault (kinda played for laughs?)
* Murder/ethnic cleansing (could’ve been a dream technically)
