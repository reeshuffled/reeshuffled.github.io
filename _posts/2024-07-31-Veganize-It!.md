You can buy vegan products at the store and some are better that way because of industrial process, but other times making things at home is cheaper and tastes better. 

I personally like looking for vegan specific recipes because they are recipe tested specifically for those ingredients, however you can always substitute things from your favorite non-vegan recipes. 

This is somewhat related to [Vegan Substitutions]({% post_url 2024-07-31-Vegan-Substitutions %}), but this article is more focused on making things vegan through substitutions in the ingredients list.
