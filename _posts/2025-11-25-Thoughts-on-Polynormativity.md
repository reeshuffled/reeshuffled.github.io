[*the problem with polynormativity* by Andrea Zanin](https://sexgeek.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/theproblemwithpolynormativity/)

The model of polyamory that the media has kind of run with places couples as the core concept.
* Polyamory as people having multiple partners is the most easy to understand from a monogamous point of view.
[*Nonmonogamy by the Numbers* by Tim Requarth](https://slate.com/technology/2024/05/polyamory-nonmonogomy-dating-relationships-sex.html)
* The kinds of stories and research shared of non-monogamy in the past certainly centered around rich White people, but studies do not show a link. A representation/visibility bias is all. And this is just how the media works unfortunately.
    
[*Polyamory Acts On More Than Just Romance*]({% post_url 2025-05-26-Polyamory-Acts-on-More-Than-Just-Romance %})
* I said Polyamory in this article and I might have meant non-monogamy as an umbrella, but there is something to be said through a polynormative lens. This is because even if you are practicing polyamory you will likely be able to have deeper relationships even if they don't become a romantic partner of yours.
    * This can easily lead into hierarchical polyamory which I don't really personally believe is a good model, but people are free to practice whatever they want as long as everyone consents and is happy with the arrangement.
    * Non-monogamy has so many rich philosophies on how to relate and connect with people outside of the construct of a couple that are more radical and transformative that I think people could benefit more from.

[*Adopting Relationship Anarchy as CNM*]({% post_url 2024-06-09-Adopting-Relationship-Anarchy-as-CNM %})
* I was never really attracted to Polyamory. I sometimes used it as shorthand to explain it to friends/family, but upon reading Zanin's article as well as their book *More Than Two* I realized how important the terminology I was using really was.
* Relationship Anarchy is certainly radical and deserves the name, but I do wonder if it is a barrier to widespread adoption.
