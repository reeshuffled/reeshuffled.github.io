## What is emotionality and what factors affect it?

Emotionality is "the degree to which an individual experiences and expresses emotions, irrespective of the quality of the emotional experience" ([Source](https://dictionary.apa.org/emotionality )).
* This is different than emotional distance in a relationship where you don’t feel close to the person.
    * Although the emotionality gap can be a reason for why you might feel distant from your partner.
* The way in which someone relates to their emotions can drive solutions-oriented thinking and discussion.

Emotionality is gendered.

## How do interactions of different emotionality levels play out?

There is of course someone who might be "average" or more "neutral" on the emotionality scale but in a relationship with a High this would read Low and with someone Low this would read High.

High-High
* Pros:
    * You will be able to share in highs and lows together as high emoters.
* Cons:
    * There might not always be enough time or space to listen and hear to each other’s feelings.

High-Low
* Pros:
    * The High doesn't have to compete for emotional space
    * The Low could become more emotional over time
* Cons:
    * There can be resentment or confusion about whether or not your partner loves you/enjoys spending time with you.

Low-Low
* Pros:
    * Both might be perfectly happy with the arrangement and not feel burdened by someone else’s emotions.
* Cons
    * A lot of romantic media has people with average to high emotionality so one or both partners might begin to wonder if the other person truly loves them or enjoys spending time with them.
