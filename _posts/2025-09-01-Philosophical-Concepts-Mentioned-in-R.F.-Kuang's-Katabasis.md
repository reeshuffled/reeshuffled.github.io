I loved Kuang's Katabasis because of how well-versed she is in philosophy. While she may not go into depth in any one particular concept, I think she does a great job at giving readers simple explanations that can plant the seed of curiosity for further exploration. With this list, I am trying to give people a good jumping off point to become interested in philosophical concepts/topics that interest them. I have tried to keep track of all the concepts that she mentions in the book (I certainly may have missed some), but I have also added related concepts that I think would also be of interest too. For topics that have not been mentioned in the book, I will put an asterisk (*) in front of the link.

I am mostly linking from the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/), but this can be quite in-depth for a introductory delve. I would also recommend the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/) and [Crash Course Philosophy](https://thecrashcourse.com/topic/philosophy/). Honestly once you have the terminology down you are able to search on your own; be curious and question everything!
