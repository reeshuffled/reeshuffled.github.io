## What is partnership versus companionship?

A somewhat popular distinction I have seen floating around has been partnership versus companionship. To gather a rough sense of these words, I have found some real-world usages of the terms.
* Partnership
    * Working partnership: a collaborative relationship between two or more entities (individuals, organizations, or countries) working together to achieve a common goal. It involves shared effort, resources, and decision-making, with the aim of leveraging collective strengths and expertise. 
    * Romantic partnership: a close, intimate, and usually long-term relationship between two people, characterized by mutual affection, emotional support, and shared experiences. It involves a deep connection, commitment, and the potential for physical intimacy.
* Companionship
    * Medical companion: can refer to several things, including a professional caregiver providing support during medical treatments or hospital stays, a patient advocate coordinating care, or a program assisting veterans with post-operative recovery.
    * Animal companion: a pet primarily for the purpose of having a friend or for entertainment, rather than for work or practical purposes. These animals, often dogs or cats, provide emotional support and can significantly impact a person's well-being.

In an [article by SimpleeTherapy](https://simpleetherapy.com/2022/02/07/companionship-vs-partnership), she says that companionship is characterized by: 
* A desire to spend time together
* Someone to go on adventures to new places with
* Loyalty
* Someone to hang out with and meet others
* Someone always up for some fun
* Someone to provide comfort and a listening ear
* Unconditional love

I think that she goes too far here with stipulating "always" and "unconditional love", for I don't think that there is any reason to impose such strict parameters. So if we revise this:
* A desire to spend time together
* Someone to go on adventures to new places with
* Loyalty
* Someone to hang out with and meet others
* Someone you can have fun with
* Someone to provide comfort and a listening ear
* Love

This to me already sounds a lot like partnership, to which Lee agrees and says that, "Partnership requires all of the above and then some. A healthy partnership has shared values, parallel goals, and mutual support". When she says parallel goals I think she more means it in the sense of shared goals, but I can't be too sure.

## Call It What You Want

Partnership versus Companionship is probably something best represented by a Venn Diagram.
* They are likely very similar with some slight differences.
    * Companionship doesn’t seem to involve equality (necessarily) or a sense of a co-created future.

I think I am more drawn to the concept of companionship because on the face it seems to better match my motivations for relationships; I tend to want to get in a relationship because I want to have fun and share experience with people.
* I genuinely enjoy the other person’s company it’s not like just anyone would work.
* I have less support needs so the idea of a partnership doesn’t appeal to me as much.
    * You wouldn’t call your friends your partners (usually) but they still support you.
* I want to help someone accomplish their own goals rather than having shared goals.
* I am a more independent person so even something like waiting to watch a TV show together with someone else can become tiresome.
