Being attuned to time so sensitively seems bad, so should I be tracking time? 
* being more aware of time makes you realize how little you have which can cause anxiety
* it makes you watch the clock more
    * in tracking my time on my calendar, it would affect the time i would start tasks because it wouldn't as cleanly display/input into the calendar

How can we balance [calendar as memory]({% post_url 2024-02-12-Calendar-as-memory %}) with not being as time obsessed?
* We can try to create [a calendar with no duration]({% post_url 2024-02-05-A-calendar-with-no-duration %})
* "Quiet tracking"
    * Tracking in the background that is automated so that it’s non-invasive (ish)--out of sight and mind

Instead of YouTube and Spotify watch/listen time, focus more on last.fm-esque metrics which is more about number of songs listened to
* what if we removed all the references to time in YouTube? 
    * The play bar would still be there so you have a proportionality idea of the time, but we would move timestamps and other time related things.
