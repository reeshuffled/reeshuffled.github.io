I am a tinkerer, someone who likes to make incremental changes towards some ideal future, a more perfect state.
* I believe my space is always unfolding and evolving into what I have always dreamed, either consciously or unconsciously.
* I find delight in trying new things out and also for my friends to notice what changes I've made.
* I enjoy novelty and do tend to get bored of my space if I haven't changed something in awhile.

I iterate rapidly and try not to punish myself for "making mistakes".
* If I try something and I don't like it or it doesn't work, I remove it. 
    * I have also removed things and only to bring it back much later on many occasions.

I identify a need within my space and then address it with design.
* Once I have found something functional/practical, then I try to make it beautiful.

## Designing For Me

Constraints/unique interior qualities drive innovation.
* I like things that can have multiple uses/that can be repurposed, especially since when living in a smaller space where you can't have as many things.

Things that work in someone else's space will not always work in yours.
* Lifestyle, cost, or other interior constraints will limit you.

Your space may host others, but it is ultimately yours.
* I enjoy hosting so I do keep other people in mind, and have ample seating for example. But at the same time, mirrors and other things are hung to my height since I am taller.

## My Aesthetic Preferences

* I want my home to feel cozy and lived-in and to represent who I am as a person. 
* I don’t like empty space, but I do not want to feel claustrophobic either.
    * Busy and maximalist, but not cluttered 
    * Walkways to be functional and I don’t want to feel confined
* I want to feel secure. 
    * I don’t like leaning things or furniture that is too thin or suspended or made of glass.
* Home decor should be fun. 
    * I like bringing some whimsy into my home
* Things should have some kind of meaning/sentimental value if possible.
* I want color but not too much color. 
    * I naturally prefer darker colors but can’t always choose that because I do want my house to have some brightness. 
* I am drawn to the perfectly imperfect. 
    * Messy, but in a not a sloppy way
    * I don’t think that I have good enough skill to pull this off most times though
