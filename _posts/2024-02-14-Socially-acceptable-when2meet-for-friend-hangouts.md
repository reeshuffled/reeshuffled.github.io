description: How can we create something like when2meet to schedule hangouts with
  people in a way that doesn't seem overly business-y?
type: stub

the [scheduling tango](https://maggieappleton.com/speculative-events) described by Maggie Appleton is so relatable
* when2meet isn't perfect and neither are appointment calendars, but they are a step in the right direction i think
* the only problem is that it may seem too business like to schedule time in this manner
    * is this just a social norm thing that we can get rid of?

is there a social algorithm that we could use?
* is it more effective to ask people when they are free or when they are not free? and then work from there
* potential algo:
    * you both send which days you prefer and then find a commonality
    * with the common day, you send which times you prefer and then find a commonality
    * you lock in the day and time that you both agree to
* if you front load the days and times that you are free the text takes too long
    * but if you space it out over texts, you are then dependent on when the other person responds
