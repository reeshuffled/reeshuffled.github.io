As discussed in my first list, [Vegan, Nut-Free, High-Protein Packaged Snacks]({% post_url 2025-06-18-Vegan,-Nut-Free,-High-Protein-Packaged-Snacks %}), I have been looking for foods that are high in protein to help me in building muscle (especially during a cut).

I am not really using the term "anabolic" in its most correct sense, but more so in a way that generally supports muscle growth.

10 is a commonly accepted good CTP ratio, and anything that gets closer to 4 (the number of calories in protein) is better.
