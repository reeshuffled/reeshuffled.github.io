A dopamine menu is a list of various things that can give a person dopamine, which may help regulate someone who is feeling overwhelmed and/or under-stimulated. Each is unique to a particular person and their likes/dislikes, but I think there are a lot of common ones you can take when building your own. 

I used various articles when trying to build this one, but found that a lot of the examples were quite generic, so I tried to come up with various other things that could be done at my apartment, and abstract that out.
