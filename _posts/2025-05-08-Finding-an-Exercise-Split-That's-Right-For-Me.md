In my [Beginner Lifting Journey article]({% post_url 2025-01-24-My-Beginner-Lifting-Journey %}), I talked about what I had been doing and what I was planning on doing in terms of my lifting routine. I haven't been afraid to experiment and try new things/change up my routine, but I have landed on something that works for me right now.

## Timing

I lift before work (~8:00am).
* I work a 9-5 job that is hybrid (2-3 days in person/week).
    * Working out in the middle of the day is not ideal because my meeting schedule could differ, which would mean that I wouldn't have a consistent time to workout.
        * However I want a consistent workout routine, which means that my only possible options are either before or after work.
    * I don't want to workout after work because I'll definitely be too tired.
        * I also like to use pre-workout to combat some exercise-induced fatigue so I don't want to have that much caffeine so late in the day.

I only lift on weekdays.
* I want my weekends to be free, especially because it lessens the burden of a weekend trip and trying to find a gym to get a workout in.
* I do two different full-body sessions twice a week (R-A-B-R-A-B-R).
    * With the more popular PPL split I wasn't able to have sufficient rest (for me) and also hit legs twice in one week.
    * Session A is basically just Pull and B is basically Push.
        * While Push-Pull order is more popular, I didn't want to start out my week with my heavy presses and a lengthier session.
        * Order really doesn't matter all that much, it is just convention.

## Exercise Selection

I try to target muscle/muscle groups by one heavy compound and one isolation.
* I don't want my exercises to be too redundant/fatigue the muscle too much that would require longer recovery.
* Session A
    * Back (Rear Delt Fly, Lat Pulldown, Low Row)
    * Biceps/Brachioradialis (Preacher and Hammer Curls)
    * Forearms (Curl)
    * Hamstrings (Curl)
* Session B
    * Chest (Bench Press and Fly)
    * Shoulders (Overhead Press)
    * Triceps (Extension and Push Down)
    * Quads (Press and Extension)
    * Calfs (Raises)

I try to sequence my movements so that I am not hitting the same muscles two times in a row.
* I like to give my muscles time to rest so that I can lift heavier.

I mostly avoid [unilateral exercises](https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/unilateral-exercises).
* Unilateral exercises are best for hypertrophy and muscle imbalances but they do take longer, especially if you are resting in between sides.
    * I also tend to feel more fatigued after unilateral sets although I am not sure if that is supported by science.

I don't do exercises that don't feel good to me or are too form-dependent.
* Dumbbell/Cable Lateral Raises hurt my elbows
* Dips hurt my sternum
* I avoid Deadlifts/RDLs and Squats because I am scared of hurting myself and they aren't strictly necessary for hypertrophy

## Equipment Selection

I prefer machines for better isolation.

I prefer pin-loaded machines for easier loading.
* Loading plates is really annoying but sometimes the only option especially at higher weights.

If there isn't a machine, I try to use cables when possible because there is constant tension.
* i.e. better resistance profile usually

I use the rope attachment for triceps exercises because I find that it is easier on my wrists.

I try to avoid exercises that would need D-ring wrist cuffs because it tends to dig into my skin and hurt.

## Reps and Sets

I only do two sets per exercise.
* 2 heavy sets will still be good for growth even if not the most optimal 
    * It is on the lower end of the recommendation of sets per muscle group per week, so in some ways, I am sacrificing volume for consistency.
    * 3 sets would probably be optimal, anything else makes me think that you could go heavier and that you are artificially limiting yourself.
* I used to do two sets for awhile, but then got anxious seeing so many people recommend 3 sets per exercise so I caved and switched for a bit.
    * 3 sets of each exercise takes too long and tires me out and also means I can’t do cardio in same session because by the time I'm done with lifting, it’s time to go to work.
        * I could wake up earlier, but that would mean I would have to sleep earlier, which I don’t necessarily want to do.

I lift within the 5-10 rep range.
* My main target is 5-8, but sometimes the weight jump doesn't happen at 8 and can only really happen at 10.
* This range leaves enough effective reps while allowing me to lift heavy, especially in combination with only two sets.

## Cardio

I do cardio after my lifting if I have time.
* A little cardio is better than nothing, especially since I have a desk job where I am not moving around.
* I just wouldn’t do cardio in another session it was too much work to get ready again its the friction it would also be extra laundry to do and i don’t have in unit laundry so that would be an additional complexity 
* Cardio killing your gains is an overgeneralization 
    * Cardio before lifting would necessarily fatigue me which would be suboptimal.
    * I am running for ~30 mins so my optimal post-workout protein intake window isn't compromised either

My cardio of choice is incline treadmill.
* I can get my heart rate up if I want, but I also don't want to cycle because I don't want to exert my legs too much.
