I don't plan to create a new definition of play because many have already tried that, and I still feel like I don't have a total grasp of all necessary concepts. But I do think that play is very important, and I want to know how I can isolate it and introduce more of it into my life as a daily practice.

## What are the potential attributes of play?

* is play fundamentally unserious?
    * “Engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose.”
        * [https://www.encourageplay.com/blog/16-different-types-of-play](https://www.encourageplay.com/blog/16-different-types-of-play)
        * This means that watching a movie is playing. (Unless you build out the concept of engage to be active)
* does it have to result in fun?
    * fun isn’t or shouldn’t be the only necessary and sufficient condition because you can have fun doing your math homework
    * doing math problems for the sake of themselves would be play
* must it be non-goal directed?
    * what you're playing might have a goal, but what is your goal with play?
        * games have a clear goal
        * improv and acting have a goal to continue the scene or to express an artistic concept through the medium
    * autotelic versus instrumental (Suits)
* is play active or can be it be passive?
    * imagination is still active even if you aren’t moving your body
    * watching as an active audience member at an improv show versus watching a movie in your house seems like one could be more like play than the other
* is play intentional and voluntary? 
    * do we have to understand/know that we are playing?
        * this would mean that children aren’t really playing (which doesn't seem like an indefensible position, but does seem to greatly diverge from folk concept of play)
* can we play by ourselves?
    * yes of course there are many single player games for instance
* can one person be playing while another isn’t?
    * does everyone have to be having fun?
        * is the bully playing when hurting someone and deriving pleasure from it?
        * it isn’t voluntary from the victim’s perspective so perhaps this is more the disqualification 

## Game-Centric Notion of Play

I think we primarily play through games.
* Suits: “Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.”
* When we are playing a game, are we always engaging in play?
    * No I don't think so
        * Ex: What if you are playing cards just to pass the time before going to the airport?
* Are sports games? Are sports play?
    * There is overlap, but are they the same?
    * not all sports are games, some are performance
        * some are judged competitions like figure skating so is no different than a county fair pie contest
        * sports rely on an institution of sorts: you can figure skate on your own for fun, but that is very different than choosing to compete
        * some sports may have evolved from primitive to sophisticated play (Suits)
        * sports are about skill, in ways skill is more tangential to play
    * games and sport are competition but also play? can they be both at the same time?
        * does competition crowd out possibility for play?
        * professional football players are playing the game of football, but since they are getting paid so much, i do not think they are really engaged in play, they are at work (and someone can enjoy their work, but that does not make it play)
        * competition doesn't matter, but the fact that they are engaging in the game for reasons (primarily) outside of the love of the game

Can we play at non-games?
* Flirting as play, but maybe we could phrase flirting as a Suitsian game
* Physical play like play fighting, sex, or exercise?
    * Calisthenics versus weightlifting as play? or just physical activity
    * Dancing / gymnastics 
* Is improv/acting a game?
    * play acting house is a very early form of play for children — this is a socially conditioned / sanctioned form of play
    * is improv a game or it just happens to share the word game?
    * it is more an art form, but there is a lot of interpersonal interaction and humor involved, so could lead to play
* teasing and making jokes
    * is humor (incongruity) related to play? is the only connection laughing?
