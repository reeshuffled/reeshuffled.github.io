I believe that there are certain limiting beliefs that people are socialized or come to choose to believe that genuinely prevent certain forms of meaningful connection in a person's life.

## What is a limiting belief?

“Limiting beliefs are negative thoughts or assumptions that can prevent you from moving forward in your life.”

## Monogamous Hierarchical Conception of Love

In Western culture, I think that the main conception of Love is the Monogamous Hierarchical Conception of Love: You have one person who you dedicate the most of your time, love, and attention to. This idea is at the crux of our modern cisheteropatriarchical society. There is this expectation of having only one romantic partner at a time, while that notion of exclusivity for friendship is not assumed, and would in fact be considered fairly toxic if you expected this person to be your only friend and not have them have any other friends.

## I can only or only want to talk to my partner about my day (everyday).

This limits connections that you are making with other people. It also puts undue pressure on your partner to be in constant communication.
