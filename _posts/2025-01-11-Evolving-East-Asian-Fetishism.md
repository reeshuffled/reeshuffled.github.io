A lot of analysis/personal accounts that I have read about East Asian Fetishization or "Yellow Fever" has been centered around the "[sexotic](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363460718790863)", which is to say the interplay between between sexualization and exoticization as it pertains to them being Asian in a predominantly White society.

I still absolutely believe that there is a lot of sexual fetishization of East Asian women happening, but it isn't happening in a vacuum. I think that there are cultural forces moving the Western cisheteropatriarchal beauty standard toward more East Asian.
* The East Asian beauty standard has definitely been influenced by Western beauty standards, but I think we are going to start seeing Eastern influence on the Western beauty standard, and perhaps even the development of a more prescient global beauty standard.
    * There are lots of East Asian people in the world and with those numbers comes influence. Via globalization there is a lot more awareness of East Asian media and culture as well.
    * A lot of the beauty standard is around [pale and smooth skin](https://nextshark.com/east-asian-pale-skin-beauty-standard), likely motivated by ideals about perfection and purity.

Not only that, I believe that Asian-ness itself is now being fetishized. It is less about the exoticness of erotic, but the proximity to cultural tastemakers ("the cool"). I believe this in part because of Hallyu (Korean wave of K-Dramas, K-Pop, etc.) and other rise of other forms of East Asian cultural soft power, like the popularity of Japanese anime. 
* This seems different than stereotyping because I don't think that the traditional stereotype is that Asians are all cool.
    * However it is still very harmful because it is still a powerful form of Othering.
* Asian = Cool
    * Ex: [Thing, Japan Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thing-japan)
    * [Techno-orientalism](https://thechloegong.com/2019/12/28/techno-orientalism-in-science-fiction/), while mostly xenophobic and fear-mongering, may have tapped in the unconscious of Asian = Cool.
* In a time where whiteness as the dominant standard is being called into question, I think that many may try to get away from Whiteness. This is particularly made material by [the rise of the online RCTA (“race change to another”) community](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/race-change-to-another-trend-online-rcna93759).
    * Others may not go as far as to "change their race", so having a partner or kids that are Asian could be a next step in their minds.
* There is also a snowball effect because there could be an associated status effect of having an Asian partner.
    * If more people in power have Asian partners, then people could start to desire it more because they see other people desiring it (mimetic desire).
        * Anecdotally speaking, I've seen that in some circles of Silicon Valley, an Asian partner is what is strived for or what is talked about as something to strive for.
