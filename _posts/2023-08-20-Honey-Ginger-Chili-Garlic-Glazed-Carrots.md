## Ingredients
* Carrots (Can be baby or full-sized)

* Honey
* Apple Cider Vinegar
* Garlic Powder
* Onion Powder
* Red Pepper Flakes
* Chipotle Chili Powder
* Salt

## Instructions
1. Cover carrots in olive oil and put in pan over medium to medium-high heat to get a sear on the carrots if you want, but at the very least soften up the carrots a bit.
2. Fry the garlic and ginger together in the oil with the carrots.
3. After the garlic paste has cooked down a bit, add the honey, vinegar, and the rest of the spices.
4. Once everything is coated and sticky, you are ready to serve.
