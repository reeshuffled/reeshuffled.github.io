[I am a strong proponent of regifting]({% post_url 2023-10-11-On-Regifting %}). In that previous article of mine, I mostly detailed a defense of re-gifting, but in this article I aim to identify a few items and techniques that you may apply in order to become the best re-gifter that is possible.

I’m getting into gift “baskets”. I am definitely not going to give you a basket because I think that for most people that would be too much to have to store/take care of, but I think that giving multiple small gifts can be cheaper, more sentimental, and more fun for the gift receiver!

I think that having accumulating things and bundling them to pass on to people that will appreciate it (“re-homing items”) can be a powerful way to be sustainable, declutter, and give meaningful gifts to show your appreciation to your loved ones.

Books:
* Especially if you read it and didn’t like it that much, don’t keep it on your shelf! If you did like it I think that giving them the copy you read and buying a used one online for yourself (or vice versa) is a great option. 

Perfume Samples:
* Luckyscent, ScentSplit, or free samples you get with your perfume shop orders are great ways to amass samples. There are so many times that you won’t like a fragrance, but it could be the right for someone else you know and love.

Sticker Packs:
* Be honest with yourself. You are never going to use all those stickers. Cut a few out to give to your friends or give them a whole sheet!
* Another way of using them would just be to use them right on the wrapping paper/envelope of a card to spice it up/personalize it.

Mail Clubs:
* There’s got to be thousands of these at this point but I’ve found a lot just via Instagram and/or TikTok:
    * [The Loved Club by Quinn Collie](https://www.patreon.com/TheLovedClub) (on hiatus)
    * [Aome Mail Club](https://aome.us/pages/mail-club)
    * [Roshni Post Mail Club by Alate](https://www.patreon.com/alate_as)
    * [Dairy Mail Club by Julieta](https://www.dairymailclub.com/physicalletters)
    * [Friends of Pinato Mail Club](https://pinatocrafts.store/products/friends-of-pinato-mail-club)
    * [Baker's Dozen Print Club by Maura K](https://www.patreon.com/maurakspain/membership)
    * [Joy Mail Club by Emmy](https://www.patreon.com/cw/EmmyJoyDesign)
    * [Lucky Duck Mail Club](https://www.luckyduckmailclub.com/)
    * [Bookmark Club by Kelsi](https://www.kelsimade.com/)
    * [Architecture Mail Club by Trinity](https://artsbytrinity.com/mail-club)
    * [Logbook Movie Club](https://logbookmovieclub.carrd.co/)
* What I like about this is that you can keep the things that you like and then pass on things that other people might like.
    * The gallery wall trend has cooled off a little bit in my opinion, but I think that people can always use more small art to have around the house.
    * A lot of them have a variety of art prints, poetry, tickers, bookmarks, etc.

Individually Wrapped Candies or Snacks:
* Unless you have aesthetic packaging options available to you, I would not recommend re-packaging candy/snacks from a larger bag (also just from a freshness standpoint).
* Jolly Ranchers, Ginger Chews, Starburst, etc are all easy options that you can mix and match to preferences as a bit of a volume adder to your gift bundle.
    * If I am doing a perfume sample, I usually gift it in a sheer mesh drawstring bag with a few candies just as a way to justify using the bag because I don't just want to have a loose perfume sample as a gift.

Mugs or Glasses:
* Only nicer ones but there comes a time in many people’s lives where they have to seriously come to terms with how stuffed their cupboards are.
* This is a nice vessel for a gift bundle as you can just put a bunch of other small items inside.

Candles: 
* You can sell it as already broken in but if you have too many candles that you want to try then I don’t see a bad reason to re-gift one. Consumables like this won’t clutter too much (unless they too have too many candles).
