You don't have to always bring your partner or best friend to every event.
* Before anything else, do they want to go?
    * If you are bringing someone just to be your social crutch, it may interfere with you or your +1's ability to socialize at the event.
* Some events don't call for a +1.
    * Are other people bringing +1s? Does your +1 know anyone else? Would they get along with anyone else?
    * I think that you shouldn't bring someone if the event/occasion doesn't suit them.

+1's are a powerful way to bring people together.
* If you are able to bring other people, do you have someone else who might be better suited?
    * If you're going to a film festival, bring your cinephile friend.
    * If it is a party, maybe bring your friend who just moved to the area and is looking to meet new people.
