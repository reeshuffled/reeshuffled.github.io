## What is Listening at a Distance?

I wanted to get away from the algorithmic recommendations of the big music streaming platforms. Recommendation algorithms can suggest you songs that it would think you would like, but oftentimes they don’t push you because they don't think about things that you would enjoy outside of the general area of what you already consume. As of right now, this can only be fulfilled by recommendations/curation from people.

This made me start a co-created newsletter where members can submit 1-3 songs each month for the other subscribers/contributors of the newsletter to listen to. To make matters more fun, there is list of rules called the Community Charter that constitute the newsletter/community of which can be democratically voted on and changed.

### "Conjunction Junction" by Couch

This is a local Boston band that I had the opportunity to see live. When they played this cover of Conjunction Junction (by School House Rock) the crowd went crazy. It's so groovy!

### "VROOM VROOM" by Mickey Darling

"Dressed up as my dad for halloween / just to tell me that I'm proud of me" -- I find Mickey Darling's lyrics so funny, definitely an underrated artist.

### "On The Avalon Stairs" by Fruit Bats

Figured I would put a song from my favorite band as my first ever submission to the newsletter. I started listening to them back in 2015 and have seen them in concert at the 9:30 club last year. I'm also seeing them at Red Rocks in July. This is not my favorite song from them, but it's one I've been listening to a lot recently. I love this song's chill vibe while having a heavy meaning at the same time. My favorite lyric is the chorus "We all make vows to ourselves Not to keep these things so close to our chests But it's so hard to promise ourselves That we won't lie to ourselves"

### "Home" by Good Neighbours

Adding this song as it's another one I've been listening to recently. This popped up on my Discover Weekly. I like the sound of the band and the upbeat/nostalgic vibe. Favorite lyrics are from the first line: "It's a light relief from a bad habit It's my mother's cookin' when I can't have it"

### "Baby Blue" by Rence

Every month I'm going to submit one of my favorite songs ever as song #3. Starting off with this one. I like this song because I discovered it at a time I could really relate to it. I had a crush on a girl for the longest time but I was too scared to ask her out. Other than that, this song has a really great flow to it. Always puts me in a good mood. Never get tired of hearing it. I can relate to these lyrics the most: "Saw you in September Something I should do Knew you in November Still I ain't pursuit on you"

### "Azul" by Edson & Hudson

I typically gravitate towards sad/feels music. My therapist encouraged me to expand (surprise, it actually helps). Long-story short this is Brazilian country music. All I know is that azul translates to blue and this song is fun.

### "La Bachata" by Manuel Turizo

Reggaeton! Good vibes, dancey energy.

### "STRINGS (feat. JVKE and Bazzi)" by MAX

This dude disappeared from music but just released an album of bangers. About healthy relationships and having a crush! woooo

## Rees
### "Sun is Bad" by Indigo De Souza

I found this song from a cooking TikTok and have slowly been exploring Indigo's entire discography. This song is from my favorite album of her's called "I Love My Mom", which I would definitely recommend you listen to the whole thing if you like this song.

### "half return" by Adrianne Lenker

I love this entire album "songs" by Adrianne Lenker which had some songs that went viral on TikTok last year. I think that this is a deeper cut from the album and my favorite instrumentation from the album and also has a very fun vocal performance from Adrianne.

### "Habit" by Snail Mail

Following the apparent theme of female singer/songwriter indie music in my other songs, I wanted to sneak a Snail Mail song in. For those of whom also went to Mount Hebron High School, they'll be hip because she went to our school. I like her whole discography, but first fell in love with her music from this EP of the same title.

### "Take it Easy My Brother Charles" by Jorge Ben Jor

Jorge Ben Jor is considered the father of Brazilian soul. I haven't listened to a lot of his other music, but I really like this song.

## Chase
### "Bill & Annie" by Chuck Brodsky

I found this one through an episode of the podcast "Welcome to Night Vale." Musically, the song isn't anything special, but I'm a sucker for storytelling. This song is usually for my more pensive moods, and the message I take away varies. Sometimes, it's a sad song about how you don't always end up with The One; other times, it's a reminder of the dangers of framing romance around your "only true love" in the first place. Did Bill do the right thing?

### "Enchanté" by Dirt Poor Robins

Love the vibe and instrumentation on this one. I found Dirt Poor Robins in my Discover Weekly many years ago. It's just a bop tbh

### "Beast in the Lair" by Pekoe

The harmonies!! Especially in the 2nd half!!!! Lyrically intriguing too. I found Pekoe in my Discover Weekly maybe 6 years ago and she has yet to miss.

## Nivi
### "Skin and Bones" by Cage the Elephant

I wanted to expand the artists that I listen to, and I knew that Cage had a few songs that I had really liked before. After listening to some stuff of theirs that I hadn't heard before, I found that I really liked this one.

### "My Lady of Mercy" by The Last Dinner Party

"My Lady of Mercy" is a 2023 single and track on the 2024 album "Prelude to Ecstasy" by The Last Dinner Party. This album has been on repeat for me since I discovered it through Snail Mail's Instagram story. The Last Dinner Party boasts impressive production and rich vocals, this group has a very promising future to say the least.

### "Common Blue" by Warpaint

Warpaint should be a playlist staple for those who desire quiet vocals and guitars during an afternoon of work. "Common Blue" is their latest single, and it delivers on the same tranquil formula heard on other tracks by Adrianne Lenker (Big Thief) or even Bat for Lashes.

### "Cobra (Rock Remix) [feat. Spiritbox]" by Megan Thee Stallion, Spiritbox

Megan Thee Stallion is undoubtedly a superstar, but I can confidently say I had never heard a full song of hers until the rock remix of "Cobra". This track is the perfect introduction to how Spiritbox challenges genre boundaries. "Cobra (Rock Remix)" is not a typical rap goes rock cover; it is something else entirely.

### "what if i took it off for you?" by Nemahsis

I think an important aspect of fighting for the genocide of Palestinians to end is engaging with their art and culture to help keep it alive, which is why I went searching for Palestinian artists to listen to in the last few months. That's how I found Nemah's music — she's an incredible Palestinian-Canadian singer. This song in particular really hits home as someone who wears hijab and deals with all of the externally-imposed narratives that surround that choice.

### "24" by NIKI

"I know more than I ever have/and yet I know nothing at all/I'm a floating feather/I'm a constant cannonball" — this line knots something tighter in my chest when I hear it. Being 24 has been weird. It's the first age I turned after my dad died, and I've spent my whole time as a 24-year-old feeling profoundly grief-stricken and sad and lost and so many other things. I'm not sure if this is just how you're supposed to feel when you're 24, but it's nice to know that there's at least one other person who is experiencing something similar. I don't know. 24 is a weird age and everything feels so hard but sometimes it's enough that the basket of bread is still warm.

### "DANG! (hocus pocus)" by Billlie

This song is like getting a shot of serotonin injected straight into me — the instrumentation is super fun and quirky, the song builds in a really satisfying way, the lyrics are insanely catchy. Billlie is always sickeningly cute but this song just takes the cake. Instant classic.

## Nick J
### "Seaface" by Lowertown

Really unique instrumental compositions frame the lyrics with the perfect amount of angst for this cold month. A friend showed me this duo a few months back and it’s easy to think this song was written by more than two people!

### "Respiration" by Black Star feat Common

Mellow 90s rap with my favorite type of sampling and production. 3 somewhat lesser known and fantastic rappers from the era, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, and Common.

### "Thank You" by Nujabes and Apani B

Nujabes is a Japanese producer with a very special style. Apani B’s verses praise music itself and the communities that form around it. Thank you, Music!

## Jack + Marin
### "idk shit about cars" by Evan Honer

He just came to DC so I figured I'd feature his song! This song is the perfect mix of good songwriting and folky tunes that makes you just feel good. I'll often find myself just singing parts of this song in my head throughout the day. Also, the lyrical repetition that's used somehow makes the writing stronger, with each verse putting a new twist on the same line. -Jack

## Erin
### "Pink Pony Club" by Chappell Roan

This was recommended on my Spotify last year, and it’s recently been back in my rotation because it’s just so catchy. I didn’t realize how bittersweet it was until I really listened to the lyrics, but I appreciate the extra layer that adds to it.

### "Powerful Women" by Pitbull and Dolly Parton

As someone on Tiktok described it, Dolly is just doing fun side quests at this point. Pitbull’s “Thank you Dolly—Dale!” is my favorite line in this one.

## James
### "Landline" by bikini

Came up on a daily mix

### "Whatever She Wants" by Byrson Tiller

Just released Single

### "SORRY" by The Kid LAROI

Found it last night!!
