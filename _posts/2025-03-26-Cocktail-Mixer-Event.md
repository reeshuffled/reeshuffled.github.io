The name is a double entendre because it is a Cocktail Mixer event with an activity that is centered around mixing cocktails.

At the core of this event is a game where everyone gets a card with a clue to their cocktail ingredient.
* Cards can be either randomly distributed or you can allow people to pick a card that speaks to them the most. 

The goal of the game is to figure out what your item is and to find other people with ingredients that might pair well with yours.
* You are supposed to talk to other people to decode your clue to find your ingredient, so try to make ingredient clues difficult enough that it may need more than one person to solve it, but not so hard that they don’t have any idea what their ingredients are.
* You can have an “item bank” (showing the possible items on a table) to make it easier for people to figure out what their ingredients are because they can use process of elimination.

Set a timer for X amount of minutes to have people form groups of 3-4.
* You can do more or less number of people per group but it may result in a cocktail that is too simple or with too many flavors.
* Set a timer that allows for maximal amount of socialization while minimizing meaningless discussion.

At the end, you make your team's cocktail and drink it.
* You can also have a judges panel to judge all the teams cocktails and choose a winner (if you want to make it a competition).
