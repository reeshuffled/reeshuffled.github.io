This was a meal that was born out of reincorporating my leftovers, in this case beef stroganoff. With that came the ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles. To that, I added the onions, carrots, and celery. Traditionally Japanese curry would use potatoes, but instead I went for the traditional mirepoix because that's what I had on hand. You can use any ground meat, but I think ground beef has the most innate flavor out of the ground meats. I also don’t cook the celery that long to keep it crunchy to add texture to the dish, but it’s up to you. I add the milk and water because the curry block needs 5 cups of liquid and I wanted to make it more creamy, but you could probably use half and half. It’s more soupy without the cornstarch, but it depends if you want. The mix needs to be hot for the cornstarch to activate but I don’t ever bring to a boil to reduce liquid or anything like that, not much simmering either.

**Ingredients:**
- 4 cups of Beef Broth
- 3/4 cup water
- 1/4 milk
- Half pack of egg noodles
- 1lb of ground beef
- 1 white onion, diced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 4 oz of white mushrooms, sliced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 Tbsp oil (or bacon fat if you have it)
- 1 pack of Japanese curry blocks
- 1.5 Tbsp of cornstarch

**Instructions:**
1. Boil the egg noodles.
2. Brown the ground beef and take it out of the pot.
3. Mince and garlic and dice the carrot, onion, and celery. Slice the mushrooms.
4. Heat up the oil on medium heat and sauté the garlic, mushrooms, carrot, onion, and celery until the onions are translucent.
5. Place the broth and water in the pot, and add the ground beef. Bring it up to near boil and place the curry blocks in the mixture.
6. Once the curry blocks are fully dissolved, add the cornstarch.
7. After the soup is thickened, add the milk.
8. Once the milk is combined, add the egg noodles the dish is ready to serve.
