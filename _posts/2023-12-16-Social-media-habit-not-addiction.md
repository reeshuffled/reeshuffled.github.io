itâ€™s a habit like exercise
* it becomes mindless and a reflex
* [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22668729)
    * apps are designed to hijack your reward system but a lot of things are designed for human psychology like branding and interior design 

addiction is too strong of a word 
* it trivializes other forms of addiction
* you can be addicted though
    * if you post for likes or comments, you are hooked on that dopamine rush

we crave entertainment because we have more free time due to technological increases in productivity but the same 40 hour work week as well as other conveniences that technology has afforded us 
* also life sucks so entertainment helps fill that hole
