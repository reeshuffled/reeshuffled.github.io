Modern fitness culture is dependent on factory farming. It makes it possible.
* Eggs, Chicken Breast, Lean Ground Turkey/Beef
    * All of these are cost effective options because of innovations in factory farming.
    * Cage Free or Free Range arenâ€™t much better but at least can hint at some kind of kind of better treatment of the animals but many people are going for the most cost effective option (bulk and/or cheapest) which are typically not options with the better treatment of animals. 
* Non-fat greek yogurt, cottage cheese, whey protein are used a lot in recipes as substitutions/additions to add more protein.

"Gym rats" are high-value conversion targets.
* Above average animal product consumption (More potential for reduction)
* Cost-motivated (Responsive to changes in cost)
* Taste agnostic (Mostly)
    * Many people sacrifice taste/texture for higher protein
* Health conscious
* Gets lots of information from media/can be swayed (May not be diverse media diet though)

There needs to be more plant-based bodybuilders that can be role models but not in an annoying way. 
* Male fitness content leans more right-wing, which means that the left-leaning associations of eating plant-based may require more finesse during messaging.
* You need someone who looks big and shows you can eat lots of plant protein in a day. Proof is the best signal. 
* If recipes that are cheap/easy/accessible are shared by them on social media, more people could try it.
    * Showcasing particular off-the-shelf products would be extremely effective (e.g. on TikTok Shop).

It is harder to be a vegan bodybuilder, but not impossible.
* You can get the same amount of protein as a vegan you just will have to be more creative.
    * You can also grow without heavily increasing your protein intake, it may take longer to see as much growth, but if you remain consistent you will still see the same amount of growth just over a longer period of time.
* Whey protein is cheaper and usually has better macros, but there are also good comparable vegan protein powders out there.
    * It can be hard to find a good vegan protein bar (especially nut free) but they do exist there just with slightly worse macros.
* Protein snacks are becoming increasingly popular, but they usually have a milk whey-based protein. 
    * You can find vegan protein snacks, but they might be at a more specialty store or online, so you have to be better at planning out purchasing.
* Most supplements can be bought in vegan capsules and vegans should probably take creatine and other supplements anyway.
