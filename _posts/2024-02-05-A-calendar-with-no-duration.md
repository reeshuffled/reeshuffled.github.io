description: What if we created a calendar that doesn't track duration of events?
category: Garden
type: stub

time information is encoded via relation of ordering but duration is not recorded 

is this kind of like a habit tracker?
* would something like a TODO list with history be better?

i want to know how i spend my days but is duration a necessary parameter to track in order to do that?

calendars having blank space is bad
* to me it makes me feel bad about all the time in between events that i didn’t do anything
    * in reality i probably did do things but they weren’t as noteworthy for me like tiktok or cleaning things
