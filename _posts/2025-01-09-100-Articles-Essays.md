## Identifying Trends

Since I've already [reflected at 50 articles]({% post_url 2023-11-28-Reflecting-on-50-Posts %}), I am only going to focus on my 51st-100th articles and essays.

My website has changed a lot since I hit 50 posts and I have added a lot of non-article content as well. While that is certainly something to celebrate as well, I do have a soft spot in my heart for articles and essays. I enjoy being able to have a "complete" artifact of my own ideas to share and live on my blog.

I created the essay category at first to cover the publishing of my old essays that I had written for undergrad, but I felt like the essay form was something that I wanted to explore more. I am glad to have published three new essays, and I am planning to do more in the next 50 posts.

In the 51-100 articles/essays, I felt like I wrote my most complete posts yet. A lot of times I would write articles until I felt like I got sick thinking about it, and then would publish. I still do that, but these days I usually am done with the piece by then, in part due to the fact that I have been better about breaking up larger thoughts into multiple articles.

## Interesting Post Statistics

**51st Post:** 11/28/2023 and was the Reflecting on 50 Posts article.

**100th Post:** 1/6/2025 [In Defense of Medium Friends]({% post_url 2025-01-06-In-Defense-of-Medium-Friends %}), which was initially a stub, but then I added onto later to promote it to an article.

**Elapsed Time:** It is 406 days from the start date to the end date, end date included.
Or 1 year, 1 month, 10 days including the end date.
* This was 166 days faster than the first 50 articles
* This is equivalent to posting every 8.12 days, I may want to consider targeting something closer to once a week, but I am fairly pleased with this number. I have always been more bursty with my writing than consistent.

**Total Words:** 53,701

**Average Words Per Article:** 1,074.02

This is about inline with the previous 50 articles, because I have started to use a more accurate word count algorithm.

**Longest Article:** 2,879 Words
[Listening to a New Album a Day]({% post_url 2023-12-19-Album-a-Day %})

**Shortest Article:** 110 Words
[Gifts I Gave This Year (2024)]({% post_url 2024-12-01-Gifts-I-Gave-This-Year-2024 %})

**Number of Tags:** 22
