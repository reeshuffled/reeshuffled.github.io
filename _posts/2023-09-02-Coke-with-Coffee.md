I was drawing inspiration from the idea of mixing Coke with coffee, which is not a new idea. Take the [Fat Americano](https://www.homegrounds.co/fat-americano/) for example, which is a coffee beverage made by putting espresso over Coke.

**Ingredients:**
* Coffee ice cubes
* Coke Zero
* Cream Liqueur (e.g. Bailey's)
* Vodka (e.g. Tito's)
* Sugar-Free Vanilla and Caramel syrups (e.g. Torani)
* Simple Syrup

**Substitution Ideas:**
* Vanilla vodka or spiced rum instead of vodka
* Coffee liqueur instead of cream liqueur 
* Oatmilk or creamer instead of cream liquor
* Espresso shot instead of coffee ice cubes and add normal ice

**Notes:**
* If you use regular Coke, you probably wonâ€™t need simple syrup
* Vodka is to up the alcohol percentage, but you can omit it if you want less of a buzz
