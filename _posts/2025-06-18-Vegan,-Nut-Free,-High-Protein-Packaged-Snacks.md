As someone who is Reducetarian and only buys plant-based food for my home, as well as someone who is interested in recreational bodybuilding, I want to find easy-to-eat, ready-to-go high-protein food (snacks) that I can fall back onto if I don't want to cook in that moment. To add onto my list of constraints, I am also very allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, which definitely rules out a lot of vegan snacks for me, particularly protein bars. However, it doesn't actually hurt me too much because nuts have a lot of fat so I would't really be eating all that much on a daily basis anyhow.

If you're not someone trying to up your protein intake for hypertrophy reasons, I am not sure how much you have to really be focused on it. I think that the push for more protein is something that is relatively recent and is just capitalism trying to prey on people becoming more health-conscious (in my opinion). Higher protein almost always sacrifices taste and texture, so it is really not worth it if you can eat something else that is more delicious.

High-protein isn't exactly a high bar to clear, legally-speaking. This has no bearing on how "healthy" it is, just that it has a certain amount of the recommended daily amount of protein. For me, something that is high in protein is something that has a CTP (Calorie to Protein ratio) of 10 or less that is also a sensible portion of food.
