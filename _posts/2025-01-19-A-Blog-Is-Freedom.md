The Web is accessible.
* You can publish your content for free (or cheap).
    * There are many tools available to help you create a blog, regardless of technical ability.
* You can make your content viewable for free (or cheap).
    * This allows you to be able to reach so many more people!
* A link is powerful. 
    * It can be (re-)shared easily and can be viewed anywhere on a phone or computer.

A blog allows discovery. 
* People who like your work can read all your stuff in one place.
    * Some formats like ["digital gardens" encourage wandering](https://web.archive.org/web/20240622072608/https://codingkoi.com/garden/digital-garden-model.html)/idle browsing.
* You can use [RSS](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to allow people to subscribe to your content.
* You can link to other blogs that you like that you want your readers to also read.
    * See: [What is a blogroll?](https://indieweb.org/blogroll)

You have total control* over content and presentation.
* *Within the constraints of skill/the publishing tool you use
* You can post whatever you want, whenever you want.
    * You can write all kinds of different lengths, topics, mediums, etc.
* You can change how the page looks, which in turn help how the words feel.
    * You can animate things, add pictures, videos, sounds, etc.

You control your own publishing. 
* You own all of your content.
* You don’t have to rely on editors and other people. 
* On the flip side, this does mean that you don’t have wider syndication from a publisher. However, with the internet, it is easier than ever to syndicate it. You can be quite targeted by going into online communities that have a presence and appetite for certain kinds of content.
