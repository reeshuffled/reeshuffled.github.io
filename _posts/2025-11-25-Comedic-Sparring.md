## What is comedic sparring?

It's like verbal sparring, but only with humor. 
* Adversarial comedy is another way of putting it
* A battle of wits with comedy

This is something that I've noticed a lot in my male friendships.
* [Ribbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/295k64/i_have_a_hard_time_verbally_sparring_with_my_male/) It may be male coded but people of all genders do it. It can be a very common dynamic but one that can be one you fall into and can't get out.
* Intelligence but more specifically being funny is a status thing and masculinity is of course just a status game.

You are co-creating humor, but you are not on the same side.
* Yes, and... versus No, but...
* If you were on the same side it would be like riffing.

It can be done in good nature among friends but a lot of times it isn't necessarily all fun and games.
* You are expected not to get your feelings hurt even if hurtful things are being said.
* You don't want to be [corn cobbing](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/corn-cobbed).

## What does a turn look like?

An exchange might look something like this:

> Rob: The last time John had sex he cried for hours afterward.  
> John: Hey, that was just because I stubbed my toe!

The offense is typically made up of:
* Insults and accusations (entrapment): You are insulting your target or someone close to them and maybe making unsavory accusations like they are somehow sexist and/or racist.
* Exaggeration and fabrication
* Absurdity and specificity: This makes it more funny because it seems more true but also more like a joke.

You only have so many options for defense:
* Sometimes the best defense is a good offense and so you don't respond with a defense to the offensive, but instead launch a new line of attack.
* Sometimes you might have to bite the bullet and +1 it by digging yourself deeper into the offending statement.
    * "What? I'm a real sensitive guy you know." instead of "Hey, that was just because I stubbed my toe!".
* If you truly have nothing to say, laughing and showing you know how to take a joke is probably the best thing you can do.
    * If you get mad you lose. ("What? It's just a joke.")
    * You can put on a brave face but that is counterproductive in my opinion.
* Redirection is an option but could be seen as a more cowardly move.
    * This is also depends if you do it in a funny way or not.
    * "Well at least I get some unlike you" or "That's not as bad as the time David shit himself".
